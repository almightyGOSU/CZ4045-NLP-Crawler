Smelly cat, smelly cat what are they feeding you?

Ever wanted to find out how dogs can sniff out that smelly cat? Today’s Pet Care Tips tells us how! 

Find out everything you need to “nose” about how dogs smell and why their sense of smell is so much better than ours! 

What you’ll learn will be surprising and “snot” what you expect!

Remember Defu the macaque, which we rescued from a car workshop? Together with Wildlife Reserves Singapore, ACRES: Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Singapore) and PERHILITAN, we were able to repatriate Defu to Malaysia. Follow his journey in the video below. Remember folks, wild animals should never be kept as pets.

We are sad to say that one of our volunteers, Gypsy the Rottweiler, has passed away due to old age.

Over the years that she was with us at our school programmes and events, Gypsy has helped many people understand that a dog who is usually portrayed to be vicious, can be a real sweetheart when trained.  The children absolutely loved her! 

Gypsy has played a huge part in being a Responsible Pet Ownership (RPO) ambassador and encouraging people to be better pet owners.

Rest In Peace

Dear Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA), 

Good afternoon and I would like to seek some clarification with regards to the licensing of animal breeders in Singapore.  May I ask if AVA has a registrar of records for licensed animal breeders (especially cats/dogs/rabbits) with approval to carry out the trade? If so, could you advise me on the premise requirements/regulations to adhere to in order to be granted the license to operate, please?

A friend of mine has been solicited to purchase a cross-breed kitten, and seller is operating within a private residential estate. I would like to verify if this is legal.  

Thank you and looking forward to AVA's response soonest.

BORN FREE!

We are proud to announce that an endangered pig-tailed macaque is on its way to being successfully rehomed in Malaysia! 

Working together with Animals Concerns Research & Education Society (ACRES) and Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) as well as Malaysian wildlife authorities, we transported the macaque from the Singapore Zoo to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (PERHILITAN Negeri Johor).

There it will be rehabilitated and quarantined at a Wildlife Rescue Centre before being assessed on its suitability to be released back to its natural habitat.

We wrote to NEA about placing poop signs around our neighbourhood, they referred us to you and now I get an email to say you will refer back to NEA?

Hi, I would like to enquire if this is against Section 17 and 18 of the Sale of Food Act and Section 9(1) of the Food Regulations?

If the soya bean milk is being marketed as "freshly prepared" but it is actually being transferred from Yeo's packet drinks, isn't it a false and misleading packaging/label? 

Will be grateful for your guidance on this.

Did you get a chance to catch Oscar over the weekend? 

Here are some pictures from Oscar’s weekend visits, can you spot yourself in any of them? 

Oscar had a great time the past month meeting new friends and teaching everyone about food safety! He hopes everyone will continue to practice what they learnt! 

Remember, food safety is everybody’s responsibility!

Encounter this incident on 24 July 2015
To the owner of BMW SKA1070E
Doesn't mean it is at night you can do this to your dog!!!
Can't you lower your car window for your dog, so you can rest your mind to continue having your sumptuous supper along Geylang road. If you intend to leave your dog in the car while having your supper, then my advice is leave your dog at home! 
Still can ignore me and brush me off.  You are an animal cruelty person. 
Your dog needs to breathe too!!! Don't think your big car has ample supply of oxygen when your engine is off!
Careless mistakes becomes a lifetime of regret.
