http://getfunding.asia - Drove off another client from my office.

In the 5 years of running his business, he had no revenue.

When I pointed out this fact, he got angry, he used the word, "shit" on me.

Why would I subject myself to this insult when an entrepreneur thinks that everyone owes him a living?

http://getfunding.asia - Used to be high ranking officer in EDB. Used to be an ex banker. 

So what? I told him I did not want to see him again. I don't deserve to be called shit no matter how much money I was being paid.

Going to tell my staff to ban him from entering.

It is regrettable that I have to issue another new notification.

HALAL Certificate

I myself have done an investigation on 10 July 2015, on the Satay Cup branch operating @ Vivocity.

The above photo is a photo of the signboard and on it there is a clear black and white halal logo displayed there.

It is a shoddily printed halal logo, plastered on a signboard.

As shareholders of Satay Cup we have never been shown the halal certificate by the Director of the kiosk. We do not have clear information that Satay Cup is halal certified.

If Satay Cup is not yet halal certified it is unethical to show the halal logo misleading Muslim consumers.

We are in the process of making a formal complaint to MUIS and we would like to warn consumers about this kiosk.

Wrong NEA Certificate

Actual company operating the kiosk is Satay Cup @ TAMPINES Pte Ltd. However the NEA certificate was issued to Salet Days Pte Ltd.

The A grading was issued to the previous operator.

No Visible Exhaust

There is cooking involved in an Aircon enclosed area and there is no visible exhaust at all in the operating area.

This is in clear violation of regulations.

As Director of the main holding company we have lost control and the present operator of the kiosk can only be removed at the next AGM / EGM.

We however cannot accept our good name being made used of to mislead consumers.

Yours Sincerely,
Raymond Ng

Dear friends, customers & associates,

Regarding Parkway Parade’s Franchisee Outlet;

It is with regret that we are issuing out this Notification. However, we think that it is more important that we are upfront and honest about what is happening rather than sweeping the issues under the carpet.

We have just received word from our partner, Food Republic, that they will be terminating our franchisee’s operations at their food court at Parkway Parade.

Without going into details, basically the reason of termination is that NEA does not allow them to operate in Food Republic’s foodcourt.

We would like to say that ever since late April / early May, we have not been having a good relationship with our franchisee. Without going into details, the franchisees have not been getting satay supplies from us since late April / early May.

We have been receiving feedbacks that the food quality has deteriorated over the last 1 – 2 weeks of our franchisee’s operations at Parkway Parade. We would like to say that we did not supply those satay supplies.

Satay Cup Pte Ltd is exploring legal recourse on our franchisee operating at Parkway Parade, but we will keep that details rather private.

We are disclosing what we are disclosing now because we want to retain the trust of the consumers and we want to make amends for the mistakes made by our franchisee.

Regarding Vivocity’s Subsidiary Outlet;

Our outlet at Vivocity is taken by Satay Cup Pte Ltd’s subsidiary.

We had issue over what was claimed at that outlet, which in our moral and ethical view, we must inform the consumers. This was what was published on facebook;

We must address 2 claims that are made on facebook.

1) The Vivocity branch is 100% muslim owned.

It is definitely not true because I am a shareholder and I am not a Muslim. There are many other shareholders who are not muslims.

2) The Vivocity branch is Halal.

As shareholders of the Company we have yet to see any Halal Certificate in spite of our regular request to see the Halal Certificate.

In light of the Ramadan, we would like our Muslim friends to get informed that Satay Cup outlet at Vivocity is NOT likely to be Halal. We do not want our Muslim friends to eat after sundown at our outlet thinking that it is Halal.

We would like you to be part of our community. Forgive our incompetence at containing the situation, we are doing the best we can. Help us to rebuild trust with the consumers. And to thank our consumers, we are going to treat anyone who signs up to the list with a Satay.

We thank you for your patience and forgiveness.

I am speaking as a person who is a tenant of this place, and not an agent with a CEA license.

I am renting this place near to Kallang Bahru, and I am not able to use the full space. I am asking the people here to see whether we can work together.

This space is about 1200 sqft. It is very near to town, and this place would be good as a distribution point of logistics if you have a business that requires that.

The rent is not high, about S$ 1.90 / sqft.

Do message me / comment on this thread to see how we can work together. 
Thanks.

Dear Friend,

My friends have always asked me, "I have money to fund my own business, why do I need to raise investments".

However, getting investments is NOT because you don't have money. Even if you have money you should at all times get investors to invest in your business.

The reason is very simple. If you have investors, your investors would want to make sure their investments work out. 

For example, our Satay Cup business, we get investors and in fact giving out big percentages securing their dividends. The reason is because we want more investors to be a part of this, and in the process make the business marketed by more people.

We are in the process of mobilizing capital up to a million, and looking at the trends more millions are coming.

Those who want to know more about this process, please be at our sharing session on 9 April 2015 (today), 7pm, at our office address (420 North Bridge Road, #05-27, North Bridge Centre, Singapore 188727).

RSVP by messaging to http://facebook.com/raymond2.

With its convenient Satay in a Cup format, it would be easier for you to show love to your clients, loved ones & friends.

How so? with less than 2 minutes in waiting time, you can just pick up cups of satay to bring to your family members when you are going home.

You can bring some satay for your clients when you are visiting them in their office.

Satay Cup achieves its meaning when you can use it to show love and concern for people who matter to you.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away on 23 March 2015 - that day I was interviewed by Berita Minggu regarding a satay business partnership I had with a Malay entrepreneur.

Mr Lee Kuan Yew's funeral was on Sunday, 29 March 2015 - that day the interview was officially published on Berita Minggu.

I don't think I am the first chinese to partner with a malay entrepreneur, but to have our interview and publication so closely related to a man who played a huge part in Singapore at inculcating racial and religious harmony.

The irony is that these important dates fell on the dates of this man's passing and his state funeral procession.

As I looked at my partners' happy family members, I came to realize how fortunate I am to be blessed by this relationship. I have come to realize that many things has been taken for granted.

Sunday is also the day where my partners' family members gathered at our new office to gather and to have some fabulous food cooked by my partner.

Me and my wife were dining together with our partners' families. Simple pleasures. Celebrating the little strides we had in our business, being featured in the press so early in our partnership. Having the support of investors, franchisees, and suppliers. Family members helping the people involved to ensure the greatest chance of success.

All I can say is, that I am humbled by the experience.

And I thank Mr Lee Kuan Yew for leading the government earlier on that made racial and religious harmony so readily available in the time that I am growing up.

Thanks. Mr Lee will be in my memory.

A retail business providing a service is only as good as the work done for its last customer. Quality work is always well received, but inferior work is always a painful experience in and of itself. 
To my dear friends and relatives, I rarely speech in this social platform, but today I would like to share my shameful experience with you all. It was happen at the newly renovated Lavender Bistro along Jalan Serampang.
Considering ourselves royal enough to give them support from buying bread, having a cup of tea or coffee or even lunch weekly, buying hampers and so on for the damn past 14 years. So in view of their current renovation and decoration to provide a fascinating dining experience, I can wait no longer to visit them after their opening on 18th June. No doubt this refreshing look has shown us their strong decision on providing a more variety types of dining experience in town.
But today, a heartbreak experience makes me decided to share with you all. Approximate 15:30, 6 of us would like to have our tea-time in Lavender. But even some of us just took our lunch not long ago. We still placed an order for 4 main dish and 6 beverages of course. Guess what ? Our awkward experience is about to begin. The waiter told us since there’re 6 pax of us, we need to order 6 main dish in order to allow us continuing sitting on 2nd floor. I said there were no clear signage on the staircase to indicate this “consuming rule”, if we aware with your restriction downstairs, we definitely will not come up. As a consumer, we believe majority of us will understand this. Somehow a pretty lady came forward to find out what’s going on?
Me = I’m so sorry. We weren’t aware with your new business model as every pax have to order their main dish in order to sit upstairs.
She = In that case, this time I give you all exemption, you can continue your food here.
Lady boss came = You have to understand, we open shop to do business. All kind of customer we also experienced before. Some of them can just order their beverage and spend few hours sitting there. So we have to practice this on 2nd floor.
She = Don't bother them, they like to complaint then up to them!
I think if I am rich enough, then they will not insult me with this attitude.
Surely they will correct this problem with all due diligence and haste in order to retain their commitment to the quality service that keeps them in business. Retail and service companies live or die on customer referrals, and a dissatisfied customer's bad news travels fast. Worst thing was, our 14 years relationship came to the end of this arrogant attitude. And bear in mind : Anyone with a positive attitude, his failure is temporary. And anyone with a negative attitude, his success will be temporary as well.
