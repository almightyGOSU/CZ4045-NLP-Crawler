Hi, I have tried getting dehydrated venison 8lb from a few pet shops but all out of stock. May I know where can I get it? I need it urgently as my dog is diabetic and can only take this. He has been having this diet for the past few years. Please advise urgently as my current food can only last for a couple of days.

Hi all! :)

Food for Shelters aims to help consolidate item donations for various dog-shelters around the island. We currently have two shelters under our distribution list - Mdm Wong's Rescue Shelter and HOPE Dog Rescue. I am Veana, and I am the only one in-charge of this page.

Items you donate will help feed the dogs and cats, and provide a more comfortable time at the shelter. Monetary donations can also help with emergency medical bills and other medical supplies for the sick and injured rescues.

All donations (item/monetary) will be posted weekly/fortnightly on this Facebook page along with the amount and donor's name to maintain transparency and trust.

Feel free to check our photo albums for more information! You are also welcome to clarify your doubts with the two shelters mentioned, at

1) Mdm Wong Shelter: 
https://www.facebook.com/Mdmwongsshelterandfriends

2) HOPE Dog Rescue:
https://www.facebook.com/Hopedogrescuesg

#FoodForShelters hopes to distribute the donations at least once a month, and we will not be able to do it without your help! Any amount is greatly appreciated, and I thank you on behalf of all the rescued cats and dogs!

The dog, Argos, is important in early Greek literature and mythology. Argos was the dog of Odysseus. He belonged to Odysseus as a pup.

Odysseus left for the Trojan was and was gone for twenty years (ten years fighting the war and ten years on the return home). Finally, when Argos was twenty years old, Odysseus returned to his home disguised as a beggar to see how things stood.

No one recognized him — not his son, not his wife or any of his servants. Only old Argos knew his master. When he saw him he wagged his tail. He gave a final whimper and died.

It’s a heartbreaking scene in the #Odyssey. #DogStories #Argos #AddictionSingapore

Touching Dog Story: Capitan

The death of a Miguel Guzmán of Argentina in 2006 evidently hit his loyal dog the most. On learning about his master’s death, Capitán ran away his home. And when the rest of the family started to search for the dog, they were startled to see Capitán guarding the grave of Guzmán. He had located the cemetery on his own! And as of 2015, Capitán continues to stay by his master’s side. #DogStories #Loyalty #Dogs #AddictionSingapore

Pet Food Tip: Look for the Adequacy Statement

Check the pet food label for a nutritional adequacy statement. This statement will read something like “This food is complete and balanced for all life stages,” “This food is complete and balanced for adult maintenance” or “This food is complete and balanced for growth and reproduction.” Puppies have different needs than senior or adult dogs. So choose your dog’s food accordingly. #PetFoodTips #PetFood #DogFood #DogFoodTips #AddictionPetFoods #AddictionSingapore

We're paying tribute to the world's most loyal dogs as we know them today. For sure there are countless stories that prove a dog's loyalty but let's start with the touching #Hachiko.

Hachiko, an Akita Inu, is one of the most loyal dogs in history. Hachiko would meet his owner every day at Shibuya Station in Tokyo as the owner returned from work. In 1925, the owner died while at work and never returned home. Hachiko returned to the train station day after day, even escaping from new owners to await the return of his deceased owner.

A statue of Hachiko now stands at Shibuya Station, and the spot where Hachiko stood for many years is marked with a set of bronze paw prints.

Q: Should I Change My Dog Food According to My Dog's Life Stage?

A: Yes! Like humans, dogs have different nutritional needs depending on their life stage. Puppies, and lactating and pregnant females in particular, need plenty of calcium and magnesium for bone health and growth; older animals typically need fewer minerals to avoid kidney damage.

Because of these different requirements, be sure to always buy pet food that’s specifically balanced for the life stage of your pet.

If your dog has one of a number of diseases, such as arthritis or renal disease, his problems could worsen if you feed him an incorrectly balanced food. To avoid problems, there are foods that are especially designed for these issues, which dogs can eat indefinitely.

There are even foods specifically balanced for shorter-term medical problems like obesity, bladder infections, vomiting, kidney stones, and anemia.

If your dog is on a special food for a short-term medical problem or a short-term life stage like being a puppy or pregnancy, be sure to switch onto the new dog food — or back to the old food — gradually or your dog could suffer vomiting or diarrhea from the sudden change. The transition should take at least a week.

#Rocky, a rescue lab who was shot and left for dead outside of a shelter, was hailed as a hero for leading his owner to safety while hiking in #California. He and his owner Floyd were in a remote canyon when Floyd began experiencing heart problems. He collapsed and continued to stumble and lose consciousness. Every time he passed out, Rocky stayed beside him and licked his hand until he woke up. He carefully guided his confused and ill owner through the canyon and back to their car. Floyd’s wife says if it weren’t for Rocky, Floyd may not have made it out of the wilderness alive. #DogStories #AddictionSingapore

Why is protein important to our pets' diet? In companion animals, one of the biggest demands for protein comes from the maintenance of fur and hair, which can use up to 30 percent of the daily protein intake. While dogs, cats and even humans produce about half of these amino acids internally, the other half, termed “essential amino acids,” need to be provided by the diet. 

The 10 essential amino acids are: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. If even one of these “essentials” is deficient, the body cannot make specific proteins effectively. Amino acids work in a step-by-step fashion to manufacture protein. |#DogHealth #PetHealth #HealthTips #Proteins #AddictionSingapore

Amazing Dog Stories

The joy a dog can find in comforting the stricken has transformed the Winokur family, whose adopted son, Iyal, displays symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome.

The teenager, who has damage to his brain and central nervous system, experiences rages, delayed emotional growth, and sleepless nights—all of which were undoing a family exhausted by a decade of round-the-clock care.

But within 24 hours of being paired with Chancer, a golden retriever, the family's lives were transformed. On his first night in their home, he crawled into Iyal's twin bed to sleep beside him; after years of nocturnal disruptions, the entire family finally slept until the sun came up.

Now, when Iyal has a temper tantrum, Chancer nestles next to him or lies on top of him to soothe him, and "the rages don't escalate the way they used to and they don't last as long," said Iyal's mother, Donnie Winokur.

Chancer also makes it easier for the family to enjoy their relationships with the teenager.

"I have a child with a severe disability but a huge kind heart and soul—and it's about making sure we have access to that heart and soul," says Winokur.

"Chancer helps us do that."

Chancer is the first service-trained dog for people living with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Service dogs can help children born with FAS improve self-confidence and independence.

Dog 'Tails:' The Story of Luca

Sometimes, in order to really listen, it helps when you can't hear anything at all.

That's the case with Luca, a deaf pit bull whose gift as a therapy dog comes from what others might perceive as a disability.

Luca, who was adopted as a puppy from a shelter, was trained by his owners, Brooke Slater and Dave Goldstein, to make constant eye contact so he could follow their signed commands.

For the at-risk or disabled youths with whom Luca now interacts, that can often mean feeling—and being—recognized for the first time. "He doesn't give these kids a choice but to make eye contact, because he walks right up to them and demands it," said Slater.

Luca—who inspired Slater and Goldstein to start Bruised Not Broken, a Facebook page devoted to pit bull rescue that has more than 100,000 followers—is also an ambassador.

"We are part of a program that teaches empathy and compassion. When Luca walks in the room and they see a pit bull, kids hit the deck screaming," Slater said with a laugh.

"So the first lesson is, 'No prejudice. Decide how you feel after spending time with him.' This is the work he was born to do."

Luca is a deaf pit bull whose gift as a therapy dog stems from what others might perceive as a disability. Even though Luca is deaf she has learned to follow her owners’ instructions by their special hand signals. #addictionsingapore #luca #pitbull #addictionsingapore

How is it likely that the food we eat becomes harmful to dogs? Consider these scenarios:

- Macadamia nuts, cooked onions, chocolate or anything with caffeine can be harmful to dogs.
- Small amounts of grapes and raisins can cause renal failure.
- Apple and pear seeds contain arsenic, which may be deadly to dogs.

Remember: while certain fruits are healthy for us, it may not be for out little ones. If it's dog treats we want, Addiction has them. http://www.addictionfoods.com/ #dogfood #dognutrition #dogtreats #addictionsingapore

Did you know that dogs can smell disease? Research at the Schillerhohe Hospital in Germany found dogs have an incredible ability to recognise the smell of a range of organic compounds that show the human body isn’t working as it should. That means your dog can actually diagnose your cancer, something scientists are eager to explore further, as well as diabetes and the early signs of an epileptic seizure. #dogfacts #dognose #addictionsingapore

Inspiring Dog Stories: The famous 1925 'diphtheria run.' Teams of sled dogs, including Allan Sepalla and lead dog, #Togo,  transported life-saving serum from the end of the rail line at Nenana to the site of the deadly outbreak in Nome. Air travel had become impossible due to 80 mph winds and temperatures as low as ?50 °F, so the mushers and their dogs became the only option for delivering the desperately needed medicine to clinics. A non-stop relay of teams covered 674 miles in just five days. The team that finished the final leg, Gunnar Kaasen and his lead dog, #Balto, gained the most publicity from the run. (A statue of Balto was erected in New York City's Central Park just 10 months after the heroic delivery.) But Seppala and his lead dog, Togo covered nearly twice as much ground as the other relay teams in what came to be known as the "Great Race of Mercy." #dogstories #addictionsingapore

Pictured is Alan Sepalla and his team of sled dogs, including Togo.
