Hi guys! I am working on an idea which seeks to improve Singapore's dining landscape and your dining experience in Singapore restaurants. 

But currently, I need to understand your dining habits so that I can steer my solution to tailor-fit Singaporean's needs. So, if you could spare me a moment to complete this short survey, I will be extremely grateful. Thank you!

Nothing beats the feel-good, get-together spirit of a community aka the kampung spirit. And the Singapore Democrats want to re-kindle that very Singaporean tradition.
That's why we warmly invite you to join us at the Kampung Kook-Off on 25 November 2012, Sunday, in a first-ever, fun-filled food-fair.
