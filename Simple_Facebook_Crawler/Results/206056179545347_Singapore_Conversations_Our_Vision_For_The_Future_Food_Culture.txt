Banana fritters are usually eaten during tea time. However in Singapore, this famous delicacy is eaten anytime, either day or night. Some people consume it during breakfast while others prefer to eat it during lunch or maybe supper. The ingredients in the batter will either make the banana fritters more crispy or otherwise. After frying, try to be creative by coating the banana fritters in fine sugars or chocolate sauce. This will enhance the flavouring and also attract kids to eat them. Enjoy the food while it is hot because the taste will not be as good when it is cold!

Rice is the main staple for the Chinese and they usually eat rice with chopstick. Chopsticks can come in the form of plastic, metal and ... even disposable wooden material. However, there is a taboo in using your chopstick! If you insert you chopstick vertically into your bowl of rice, it actually resembles the Chinese incense sticks sticking into an incense pot.

Prawn noodle is a creative creation of the Chinese Hokkien dialect group.
The soup is brewed with pork ribs, prawn head and other herbs to perfection over more than 4 hours, such that each mouthful of soup you taste is richly favoured with prawn. 
In order to enhance the sweetness of the soup, the cook have added black sugar canes as part of his secret recipe. He also mentioned that he did not add any MSG. This is one example of modifying a cuisine to suit its customer's taste. Hopefully, in the future, Singapore will have more variety of cuisine we can all enjoy.
Located at Ang Mo Kio Mayflower Hawker centre, Zhen Ming prawn noodles.

Kuih Dadar resembles a green burrito with brown sugar inside it. This green hue comes from the mixing of pandan leaves into the batter while it is being made. Pandan juice and coconut milk may also be added to the batter at this point, for fragrance and taste. The stuffing is made from shaved coconut and palm sugar. This sweet flavor blends with the creamy outer wrap, creating a sweet little appetizer or dessert.

This dish is one of the signature dishes of Singapore. While you can easily find people singing praises about it, simply hearing its description will make you skeptical. After all, the idea of eating a mixture of coconut milk, green noodles, shaved ice, palm sugar, red beans, glutinous rice, grass jelly and creamed corn may sound unappetizing, or even disgusting to some of you.  However, I’m sure we all have heard the saying “Don’t judge a book by its cover”. The same applies to food! With ice shavings, ice-cold coconut milk and sweet palm sugar, Cendol is really a perfect treat to beat the heat!

So lets check out a bit about the malay cuisine in singapore…The Malays came from different regions of Asia for example Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. Each region has their specific signature dishes respectively. As time flew, many different dishes were brought into Singapore and some were made into Singapore Malay signature dishes. 

Different flavors were combined to enhance the taste of the dishes. Coconut milk is the most used ingredient in Malay dishes. Coconut milk has a rich and creamy flavor. It also helps in providing a sweet coconut fragrance. Many spices are used in Malay cooking too. 

For example, Indian spices are used in Malay cooking and this shows that Malay dishes are also influenced by other cultures’ way of cooking. It is easy to find any Malay dishes in Singapore. Usually, many Malay dishes are eaten with family members during gatherings or during special occasions.
