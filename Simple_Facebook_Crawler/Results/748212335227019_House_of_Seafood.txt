Review by Daniel Food Diary: "We have heard that House of Seafood’s Black Pepper Crab was voted the best by readers of another website.

Their Black Pepper Crab base was indeed quite different – more saucy, moist and pasty, a recipe said to be specially created by their chefs, whereas some of the other versions I tried were drier and more peppery. Comparatively, this is a milder Black Pepper."
