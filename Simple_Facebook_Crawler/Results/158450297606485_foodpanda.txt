i made an order via foodpanda app an hour ago using my credit card and received 2 SMS one after another, first informing me Pastamania (Singapore) has rejected my order as the nearest outlet is facing high vol etc... few secs later, another SMS came in  with ' thank you, your order at pasta mania has been SUCCESSFULLY placed. foodpanda Team. 

An hour later, someone from Food Panda called me and said ' sorry mdm, your order wasn't successfully placed. We will refund your money within 3-5 working days'. i went WTH? it took you guys so long to call me back to inform me about the delay? I have 3 kids at home waiting for lunch to be delivered and you waited this long to tell me? 

Question here is, how could you guys even charge my card BEFORE pasta mania confirm if they can take in the order? Money was deducted even before your client (pasta mania) can commit to the orders. Is this your work flow all along???

Best part: your staff said " oh, please use cash payment next time and this is how bank works.". 

Duh. i wouldn't opt for online payment if i have enough cash at home and isn't this online food ordering app supposed to make my life easier? clearly it's not now. #unreliablefoodpanda #disappointedcustomer #badcustomerservice #pastamania #foodpanda 

FROM YOUR VERY FURIOUS LOYAL MEMBER BUT NOT GONNA BE ONE SOON.

Inflexible service! Around 11.40am or so, I ordered from Maki-San (Raffles) and someone from the store called, saying their store does not have kani sticks and asked me to replace it with something else. I chose not to because other food simply does not look appealing to me. Thus, the representative said if I were to cancel, he will have to call FoodPanda for a refund and not to trouble him, I volunteered to call myself. Called the hotline, explained the situation and end up I'm told that I NEED to replace the kani sticks else they can't proceed my order because my order falls below the minimum order amount. So here's the issue, is it my fault that kani sticks ran out when on the FoodPanda app clearly shows it's available? Shouldn't you all be more flexible with the minimum order amount when it's the store's problem? This is clearly unacceptable. To be honest, quite some time back, we had a bad impression about FoodPanda as we encountered the another issue and we decided to give you all a second chance. So far so good and bam, today another problem again. Think about the whole issue, please be more flexible next time.

Got a BK voucher from FOODPANDA due to my ill BK delivery experience with them. As such, I decided to try FOODPANDA and give them a chance. However, I unable to place the order thru website due to 0 restaurant available. 

Call the Call Center department and was told that my area does not provide home delivery address. What a surprise to me as my request delivery remain the same!

FOODPANDA, Not only you disappointed your customer again but also telling us that you are a SCAM COMPANY that provider voucher but unable to use it at all!

First time and last time! 
Ordered Nandos thru Foodpanda.sg. App told me that it will take 60mins but the moment the transaction approved, they sent show clock reflecting that it will take 88mins. We waited till 10.10pm for food arrive. Rider passed the bag and go off. We opened the bag to our disappointment found 2 boxes of corns instead of a whole chicken. Called the rider but no answer. Called the Foodpanda.sg and they said sorry we don't have rider and returned money back in 3-5 days. I demanded to speak to manager and they said no manager on duty.  I explained that it was dinner for my family and my kids need to wake up early tmr and this is their meal! All they can say is sorry we can't help... They even have the audacity to tell me the Nandos kitchen closed already. I demanded for the manager of restaurant to call me and only to find out that they(Nandos) received the order late and would have made everything possible to amend & delivered the order asap. Foodpanda.sg  then had their manager to call me and said he is on duty. Wow lies after lies. Apologies still informed me they can't do anything. Dinner tonight for my kiddos corns with rice and bread from morning, is this world war 2 time?. This is my last time dealing with Foodpanda.sg. With manager and customer service from Rahmat and gang, is just a matter of time this company will lose many more clients.

1) An item from my order does not get delivered, foodpanda promises to send a voucher to compensate for it. Never get it!!
2) Foodpanda tells me to use PANDASTIC with my order from iPhone app, it shows I should get 25% off, but unfortunately I go back on the Basket page to double check my order, and it says voucher already used. I lose the 25% discount!!

While I love foodpanda for the convenience it can provide, I am disappointed for these small little things which can otherwise go a long way in improving satisfaction.

Foodpanda, I know by expressing my disappointment to you. You will reply in this sentence (Copy n paste):

Hi Sir, our apologies regarding your experience. May we request you to write in to support@foodpanda.sg or PM us your order details so that we will be able to track what happened and how to help you further smile emoticon. Looking forward to your reply!

Let me tell you what is the root cause of the incident that caused your customer's complain on 9th August:

1) Call Center staff not professional
2) Protocol & Process are wrong
3) Miscommunication between FOOD PANDA & OUTLET
4) No alternative back up when phone call having issue.

Last but not least which is the most important things in F&B trade, MANPOWER! This is the most basic but important in number 1 list. 

It is well know to everyone that more orders will happen during weekend and P.H. If you don't have sufficient manpower to perform delivery. Then stop telling everyone how good your company can provide to everyone.

Shame on you of telling public and your partners (those F&B company) that you as being a service provider, able to provide a one stop solution to them but yet making a fool out of yourself!

An open letter to the CEO / Management team of Food Panda:

Dear Sir/Mdm,
Doing business is like a marriage, it has to be built upon the strong foundation of trust, honesty and responsibility. From the way I look at the many complaints posted, you run your business like having "one night stand". 
I am deeply concern on your capabilities and your core values of starting this business. If this is the way you choose to continue running your business, you might as well shut it down before all your customers turn their back on you. Your employees lose their jobs because of your bad management skills and values.
Your organisation is completely unstructured, your processes are disorganised and you have no service recovery plan to handle customers' complains.
Last but not least, I congratulate you as you are now officially awarded the title of "Jover Chew of the F&B industry"

Disgruntled customers.

Disappointed with ur delivery service. If you cannot handle such a large order during PH please do not commit and portray a negative image of urself in the end! 

3hrs+ and my Pizzas are still not here yet, and we are all hungry! There isn't anyway for us to cancel the order as well! Luckily i did not pay for the food yet

Definitely not going to use app again

I ordered some food and it took 4.5 hrs to come and only after 5 calls to the restaurant. It sux to tell your guests to wait till the food arrives. How does your system work?! Really...?! Would it not be easier if you guys said there is no delivery available?!

Fours hours for cold stale soggy Canadian Pizzas to arrive from the store less than 1km away.  Your service is dire, we will never use you again, staff up adequately and stop cutting corners.

Foodpanda, you committed 20:12 food delivery but till now at 20:55, your food is not here yet. I placed order at 18:12. When I call your line, 65898669, thrice, you just put me on hold till the line cut me off, thrice! Your commitment doesn't match your actions! We are still waiting for our food! Really bad service you have. You are banned!

TO OUR FRIENDS, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE FOODPANDA! THEIR SERVICE REALLY SUCKS, WE ORDERED OUR FOOD SINCE 1720 AND THEY PROMISED DELIVERY BY 1911. UNTIL NOW, NO DELIVERY AND THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AND JUST KEPT US WAITING WITH NO CALL BACK! THIS TYPE OF SERVICE LEVEL MIGHT AS WELL SHUT DOWN YOUR COMPANY!
