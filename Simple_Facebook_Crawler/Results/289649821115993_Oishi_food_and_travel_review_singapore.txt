Was at Yamagawa on 20th of April friday

FOOD

Superbly fresh amberjack..salmon toro and kenpachi toro, hotate..

1) kenpachi toro- was brilliant as you can feel and taste the milky taste of the kenpachi and best of all the knife skill of chef Gary was amazing as it swoops into your mouth and just melts the next moment

2) amberjack - many a times, i tried at various places and what you can really get out of amberjack is the extremely fishy taste of amberjack. But today chef gary really bring us the best ever amberjack that i have eaten since back from hokkaido 2 years back.

get down now and remember to book during friday saturday.

COST

went with my wife and another friend of hers. 
we paid $440 for all the premiums inclusive of cold sake. Really worth the quality. 

TRY IT 

Ask chef to get the best of the day :) - JERVIS..
