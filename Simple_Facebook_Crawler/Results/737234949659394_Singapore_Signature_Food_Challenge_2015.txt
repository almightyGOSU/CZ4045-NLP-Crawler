Bubur Cha Cha - a well known Nonya dessert, is the last course the finalist teams are required to create and re-create. A medley of sweet potatoes, yam and tapioca jelly cooked in a sweet coconut milk base is what makes this Nanyang dessert unique and close to the heart. 

Will we expect a Bubur Cha Cha ice-cream, or Bubur Cha Cha mousse cake for the modern spin? Stayed tuned. #ssfc2015 #sg50signaturefood

Chili crab is the de facto national dish of Singapore, but we are taking it a step further with the punchy salted egg yolk crab. Who can resist the almost creamy   sauce of savory and subtly spicy fragrance (curry leaves) coating every sweet morsel of crab meat. 

Cannot wait to see what the finalist teams are up to with their traditional and modern versions of this tze tzar favourite! #ssfc2015 #sg50signaturefood

Chai Tow Kueh - Some like it white, some like it black. A humble dish which had its roots in Southern China and started off as rice cakes. Here in Singapore (and in Southeast Asia), we fry it with sweet black sauce (for the black version) and add lots of chopped radish (for the white version). 

We are putting our finalist teams to the test by asking them to produce a local traditional version of the fried carrot cake with their 'Wok Kungfu' as well as putting their modern spins on this humble dish. #ssfc2015 #sg50signaturefood

Ever wondered how food was peddled door to door back in the good old days where hawker centres and food courts were non-existent? As we gather to welcome Singapore's 50th birthday, let us also take a walk down memory lane to reminisce about the "Tok Tok man" and his melodious rappings that were familiar tunes to the older generation of Singaporeans! #SG50SignatureFood #SSFC2015
