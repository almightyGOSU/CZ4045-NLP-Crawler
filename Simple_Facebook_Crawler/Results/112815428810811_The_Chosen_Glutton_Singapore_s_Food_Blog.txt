From now until this Sunday the 28th, 10 indepedent cafes in Singapore have partnered Dilmah to host a 'Real High Tea', serving exclusive (Dilmah Exceptional Premium Tea Series) tea-inspired high tea menu during this period in an effort to reaffirm the 'tea' in high tea. Time to act all tai-tai and sip tea with your floating pinkie this week (and hopefully every other week).

I had mine at Miss Molly's. They have various cake + tea set, ranging from $10 - $12. Ordinarily a cake would already cost about $8 - $9 and a pot of tea $7. So this is value for money. I haven't had a lot of Rainbow Cakes, but I quite like the one here.. it somehow goes very well with the perfumey Rose with French Vanilla tea (this series of tea is exclusive to the cafes and restaurants that hold them). #DilmahRHT #OpenRiceSGxDilmah

Had brunch yesterday at the atas precinct, Nassim Hill. It was fully booked but again, I was garang and went ahead. Fortunately we had a table immediately. Coffee ($6) was pretty reasonable, but the food was ordinary at best. Most were priced at around $20 and I don't see how the quality matches the price. If not for the Entertainer App, it wouldn't be worthwhile (after using the App it was just about $10 per person before taxes and without the drinks). #EntertainerApp

So, so late to the party v.2, lol. I much prefer this to HoneyCreme (I know the other is soft serve)! At least this feels more value for money, although still expensive for a poor student (apparently students being poor isn't commonplace anymore!). Funny how I wanted to order this but had no idea which is it on the menu until the person in front of me ordered.. "Sanum". Oh yes, then I went on to order like I've ordered it countless times. Lol. Love the Cookie Sauce! #ifinallygavemyfirsttimeaway

Part of the Omakase menu at Tburu earlier today - the grilled items. Fell deeply in love with the grilled vegetables. The smell and taste of grill on greens just some complement each other so effortlessly. #SG50 promotion going on until September. The Omakase menu is only $50. I say it's a maddd steal. Full review soon!

An incredibly interesting evening was spent at Hush TeaBar yesterday. It was an experience of not only appreciating the tea, but also the silence around you (at NOX you experience losing your sight, here, your hearing). Each TeaRista (instead of barista) is hearing impaired. The following stages are what you will go through:

1. Intention Zone - Choosing your tea leaves (called TeaMood), picking up an intention card (words left behind by previous patrons), and surrendering your handphones (love this part);
2. Hush Zone - Keeping complete silence henceforth, appreciating the tea led by your TeaRista;
3. Expression Zone - Penning down words on your intention card for future patrons, and expressing your feelings at the time on a paper with your bare hands and tea as ink (which you can later keep);
4. Sharing Zone - Sharing your experience with other guests.

Each session will take about 45 minutes. It will be opened to the public tomorrow (only happens 3 times a year, so don't miss it if you are keen), and there are seatings at every hour from 2pm - 6pm. Registration at www.hushteabar.com/rush-to-hush-.html.

It's the last weekend (Saturday) to catch the Hakka-inspired afternoon tea menu at Axis Bar & Lounge! Or well, if you prefer Teochew-oriented items instead, go from Sunday onwards (their March menu). All in celebration of #SG50. If you haven't been there before at all, go there some time - I personally like it quite a bit.

Cheng teng reduced to jelly form as starter for the 5-course afternoon tea. Very light on the palate, with dominant longan taste. Also in the elegant glass of cheng teng is pang da hai (malva nuts), commonly used as herbal remedies in Chinese medicine. #SG50 menu only for this month.

This marks my 1000th post on Instagram and I want to dedicate it @kathleenchere for being my partner-in-crime in this foodie journey (I've turned her) - her kick-ass photo-taking skills. Go follow her if you like what you see on her profile (less food photos, for sure, but natgeo standard me thinks haha). And also, to Axis Bar and Lounge at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore for having the afternoon tea to beat in SG (so far for me). We've been there three times under the blog, and I've been there three times myself outside of it. The fact that it offers a 5-course tea set is a plus because more often than not, it has a higher quality than what a buffet offers. The menu changes every month and this month, it's to celebrate #SG50. Want a go at Bak Kwa Scones (pictured)?

Berlin street snack is in town - the German currywurst (left). The recipe for sausage is customised and made by Huber's Butchery, and the sauce a spicy one with hint of tanginess. You can choose between three levels of spiciness, @kathleenchere thought the spiciest one was challenging (then again, her spiciness threshold is the lowest in our family, haha!). It's $10.90 with organic bread roll and $12.90 with fries. While the food in the CBD area is generally expensive, we still think it is a little pricey, though admittedly, it really does not taste too bad. Beer is also served here.

Available from now until the end of February 2015, this Bacon Wrapped Prunes & Goat Cheese ($14) is a must order when you are at Crossroads Café @ Marriott Hotel. It possesses an interesting medley of flavours and textures - sweet and savoury, smooth and slightly crunchy. Biting into it is like opening a kinder surprise; perfectly complementary. This limited time only Antipasti Menu is also home to other promotional items like Classic Beef Carpaccio ($17) and Gratinated Mussels with Spicy Tomato Arrabbiata ($15). Honestly, they are not as expensive as I thought it would be, considering the location, quality and portion.

Häagen-Dazs has outdone themselves again. Recently launched is its flagship store at ION Orchard level 4, the first of its kind in the world, and the first in the Southeast Asia to offer a range of exquisite ice-cream cocktails created especially for the brand by acclaimed mixologist Ethan Leslie Leong of Maison Ikkoku. Sitting on the left is the 'Black Tie', where a scoop of (my favourite) Belgian Chocolate ice-cream rests on the potent premium whiskey, while its counterpart to its right is the 'Vintage Caramel' that contains vodka, caramel liquer and Salted Caramel ice-cream (too sweet). Not in the picture is @kathleenchere's favourite, the 'Crème D'Earl Grey', where the gin, Earl Grey tea and Vanilla ice-cream are so well mixed she said she would have it again - all to herself. And no, we are no alcohol-experts, but at $18, we thought it is pretty reasonable considering the ice cream, and that there are higher-priced cocktails elsewhere. #HDSG

Thank you @zchocolat for sending over my favourite chocolates. I have been a fan since years ago - they are of the best quality and definitely perfect for a gift, especially this Valentine's Day. Pictured is the Valentine's Day Sapphire Gift Box ($170 including taxes and delivery) - 12 pieces of heart-shaped chocolates (flavours more on thr blog). I also love that it is very customisable, including adding on a heart-shaped padlock with 4-digit combination. Super 'got feel' and if you have that budget, I say you will not be disappointed, like a friend who tried the service and chocolates and liked it as well

My favourite shot by @kathleenchere and also my favourite dessert dish here. The French Toast ($9.90) is served warm, soft and fluffy, with whipped cream made in-house, that is light to the extent of not overwhelming and not cloying, and drizzled with as much maple syrup as you'd like. For the price, I personally think it's worth it. I'm only waiting for the day they introduce a possible add-on of a scoop of ice cream!

Still my personal favourite main course here, the Squid Ink Rice with Assorted Seafood ($16.50). The consistency here is maintained. For instance, the pasta is weighed, seasoning packed and boiled to according to a timer. This probably also explains why I thought this was a little salty a year ago, and @kathleenchere also thought the same when she had it yesterday. Other than that, it was great.

So it seems their cakes are still extraordinary. 80% of their ingredients originate from France. The mousse cakes are still as light and smooth as ever, and even though it's pricier than usual at $9 - $10 per slice, you are paying for real quality here!

The fourth of five dishes is one that did not quite meet the mark in our opinion. While the flavour of the tarragon and lemon butter complements the Lemon Sole ($39++), the flatfish was probably not filling as a main by itself, and parts of the surface were burnt (and bitter). Pay a bit more - go for other meat dishes!

And then, there's one of my favourite sections in any restaurant - the cold bar. Argentine cuisine is all about the meat, about the meat, no kidding - including cold cuts. All in 50g portions served with house pickles and focaccia bread, they have iberico ham (cured for 36 months, $23++), iberico shoulder (cured for 30 months, $19++), and others like salami rustico and chorizo. A bit pricey but, you should have expected no less coming here.
I'd always be torn between cheese and cold cuts as starters. At least here, there's no such headache. Lol.

The second of five dishes from boCHINche is a photogenic dessert. Fortunately, it tastes as good as it looks, offering a myriad of flavours and textures in a glass. It is a party in the mouth with the sweetness from the chocolate, saltiness from the salted caramel, and tanginess from the berries, complete in the texture of smoothness from the pudding and varying degree of crunchiness from the berries and brioche croutons. This Chocolate Pudding ($16++) proves to be one of a kind - one you will not get sick of.

The first of five successive days where dishes from boCHINche will be posted, largely because I love the pictures captured by @kathleenhere so much. Even though the new menu was released sometime back in October, it was not long ago that more variations in the seafood section surfaced. The first feature from this Argentine restaurant is our hot favourite, the Lomo Beef Fillet (300g) ($78++). Tender, firm yet sufficiently chewy, this grass-fed Argentine tenderloin cut was in our opinion, the star of the night. The texture was gentle on the tongue, and it was done beautifully medium-rare. Bigger portions can be ordered, and if you are confident enough, you can purchase the cut off its grocer for a sweet home-cooked meal. I can do with some of this now!

Christmas cakes are now available for takeaway at Antoinette. Signature classics include this intricately designed Forêt Noire ($10.70, full cake at $117.70)), suitable for a bittersweet experience if you so desire. Its base is of 66% dark chocolate mousse, and has crunchy bits within. The pairing of bitterness and crunchiness ensures that the mousse doesn't get cloying. Thank you Antoinette for the treats!

Festive season calls for festive dishes, with festive sauces! From now until the end of the year, Poulet has available 3 such dishes (except their Jurong Point outlet) just for just about everyone's favourite festive period. The popular Poulet Roti with Caramelised Apple Sauce ($17.90) hits home with its tender meat, even its breast portion. Having been brined for a day before being cooked and served on a bed of cinnamon brown sauce with caramelised apple, the power-couple of sweet and salty is easily detectable. Worth it. Other festive dishes include Rustic French Pear & Apple Tart ($8.90) and Blood Orange & Minty Cucumber Cooler ($4.90).

Poulet is also giving away a tour package worth $7,000 to France for two! Simply purchase the pictured chicken to qualify. Then go to www.poulet.com.sg to complete the qualification by telling them why you deserve it. Merry Christmas, people!

In conjunction with the launch of their waffles range, @meanbeanwickedgrind is handing out a 1-for-1 offer for any of their waffles - only for this Sunday from 11am - 7pm! All you gotta do is to regram the waffle photo with 1-for-1 on it from their Instagram page, tag them and a friend whom you are going down with this Sunday. No strings attached. Half price waffles I also want! Especially this pictured Buttermilk Waffles with Nutella Drizzle, Kinder Bueno and Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Woot!

The Entertainer App is one of those apps that I will actually pay for. Starting next year, the price will be reduced from $75 to $60. You can use the app for the entire year, with each restaurant having 3 vouchers. The app revolves around 1-for-1 offers, meaning the pictured Fillet of John Dory will cost just half the price of its original $45! Super worth it for a foodie. The 2015 edition will include restaurants like The White Rabbit, LeVeL33, and Au Petit Salut, and travel offers from Banyan Tree, to name one. Can't wait to get my hands on it for next year! Maybe the London version since I'm in the UK now. #TheEntertainerApp

Read: Pie. Face. @pieface_sg has now been successfully imported from Australia! These pies are so adorable; did you know that the mouths stand for different flavours? We thought the most value for money and worthy pie was the Chunky Steak Pie ($5.20) (with mouth shaped an 'S'), where the buttery goodness encases chunks (yes, not minced) of beef braised with onion and garlic. It's available for take-away and dining in. There are also sweet pies (like mini butterscotch pie) besides the savoury ones. #piefacesg

30 days. $30 set menus. It's 30licious once again, some delicious deals indeed by @hungrygowhere and AMEX from 3 November - 2 December. It's value for money for sure, as some of the most prestigious restaurants hop on the bandwagon as well. We had our meal yesterday at THE WEJS @ Medici Cafe at Rochester Park (@thewejs), which serves up Tunisian fare - a refreshingly exotic cuisine. Pictured is the Tunisian Chicken Cous Cous, one of the two choices for the main course in the 3-course dinner set. Check out book.hungrygowhere.com/30licious for more on the participating restaurants and the menu offered. #30liciousamex #hungrygowhere30licious

A good starter to your meal at the indie-hip, unconventionally set-up shophouse housing Moosehead Kitchen-Bar is this, guess what, you'll never know if we never say - Crispy Pig Ears. Crunchy strips opens up your palate through its spiciness and tanginess of the lime. It can last quite a long while of munching too, which makes it more value-for-money. Hah. Check out more of their globalistic cuisine on the blog (link on profile). Happy weekend!

NEW BLOG POST | Antoinette has launched a revamped menu earlier this month, featuring a whole lot of new savoury dishes, which includes my favourite Roasted Duck Breast. Plated desserts are also introduced, with the pictured Baked Alaska being the most outstanding of all. The core of vanilla ice cream, ‘griotte’ cherries cooked in kirsch, orange confit and almond nougatine are enveloped in the majestically designed torched blackcurrant meringue, poured over by the flamed Grand Marnier liquor. It's truly the best of its kind I've had.

Still missing those famed Naughty Nuri Pork Ribs in Bali. Can't find them in Singapore - tender moist meat that easily slides off the bone, with not-overly-sweet BBQ sauce. My greatest fear of sweet BBQ sauce was put to a stop there and then. Are there any like these at all in Singapore?!

Been churning out blog posts like a mad dog for the past few days before I disappear to Bali starting tomorrow and then to reservist immediately after for the whole of next week. Posts have been scheduled, but for now, a fantastic meal I had at Bar-Roque Grill. I managed to try a few dishes which will be served this next two weeks until 14 July, in celebration of French's National Day and the restaurant's first anniversary. One of the outstanding dishes available is the Bouillabaisse Broth, an amazingly rich and thick broth of saffron with fresh squids, succulent prawns, whole poached fish and rouille. A must order! You can have it during its second week of celebration.

Dishes include vermicelli with crab, smoked duck with Chinese tea leaf and black sugar, and deep-fried pork ribs with salted egg yolk, amongst others. Very, very worth it in my opinion.
