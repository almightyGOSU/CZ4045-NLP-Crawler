Food wastage is a global issue. However, efforts to reduce wastage can start from the personal level. 

We often think of reducing personal food waste in terms of what to do with food once it comes home from the store, i.e. trying new recipes, focusing on eating at home, eating food in order of perishability. But researcher Victoria Ligon, from the University of Arizona, says consumers need to think about food waste before they’ve even gone to the store.

“With the world’s population anticipated to hit 9 billion by 2050, and the global hunger crisis affecting some of the poorest communities all over the world, maybe planting and harvesting more food isn’t the answer.

Maybe, just maybe, reclaiming, repurposing, and reinventing perfectly good, healthy food into new food options is just what we need.”

Many fruits and vegetables are often filtered out and discarded at every part of the supply chain just because they do not look good enough. For example, farmers may throw away tomatoes with an extra bump on the skin, or supermarkets may throw away fruits which do not meet their high beauty standards. Almost all of these “ugly” fruits and vegetables are perfectly edible. http://www.nbc12.com/story/29606099/ugly-food-movement-aims-to-reduce-food-waste

The Alder Food Security Society (AFSS) has recruited local chefs to create meals from vegetables that would have been wasted. The food comes mainly from local farmers' market vendors, which often have less-than-ideal produce left over at the end of the day. In the past, chefs have made everything from "salvaged soup" to panini with the donated ingredients.”

You think recycling is as easy as tossing plastic or paper products into a bin? Not really. There are some items such as paper cups or food packaging that may in fact interfere with the recycling process.

“Global grain imports have increased more than fivefold over the past half century, stoking fears that countries have become too dependent on the vagaries of international markets for their food. If prices rise, or wild weather prompts countries to impose grain export bans, as Russia did in 2010, nations heavily dependent on imports could face crisis.”

During most festive seasons, we can expect the celebrations to result in a lot of excess festive foods. During the last Chinese New Year for example, we launched a CNY goodies drive and salvaged more than 4,000 cans of festive cookies. This Ramadan and Hari Raya season, let’s also donate our extra festive goodies so that they do not go to waste. Do look out for our Hari Raya Food Drive later this month!

“Seoul has introduced innovative, high-tech programs that require residents to deposit their food waste in bins, where the amount of food they toss out is weighed by household using a key-card system. Dispose of too much food and you are charged a fee by municipal officials. Seoul’s efforts could serve as a model for how a major city can recycle discarded food and keep it out of landfills.

“Pamela Ronald studies the genes that make plants more resistant to disease and stress. In an eye-opening talk, she describes her decade-long quest to isolate a gene that allows rice to survive prolonged flooding. She shows how the genetic improvement of seeds saved the Hawaiian papaya crop in the 1990s — and makes the case that modern genetics is sometimes the most effective method to advance sustainable agriculture and enhance food security for our planet’s growing population.”

“The solution to world hunger is the abolition of poverty, which is, of course, easier said than done. It requires fundamental shifts in policy priorities, the creation and defense of living wages, advocacy for people living in the Global South who struggle with the colonial legacies left behind by occupying nations, and a recognition that poverty is behind numerous social problems.”
