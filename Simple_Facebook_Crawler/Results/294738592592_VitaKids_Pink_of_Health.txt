Get Back Into Shape!

"SynaptaLean™ Rx-Fat Loss™ Promotes Successful, Sustainable Fat Loss SynaptaLean Rx-Fat Loss is the miracle solution for anyone who has ever tried to lose body fat and failed. SynaptaLean succeeds where everything else falls short. With most weight loss methods, your brain fights you every step of the way. The brain's metabolism-regulating systems think that reduced calories mean famine, so it compensates by storing more food energy as body fat. SynaptaLean researchers have discovered a unique combination of nutrients that tell your brain to stop fighting your weight loss efforts.

SynaptaLean replaces your stress and anxiety with energy and vitality you need for successful, sustainable fat loss! SynaptaLean Rx-Fat Loss, with patented Synaptose, permits healthy brain function that regulates:

Energy production and control
Appetite and craving control
Tolerance to stress
Healthy neuro-endocrine function
Healthy immune function

SynaptaLean Rx-Fat Loss is a Whole New Way to Think About Fat Loss!
SynaptaLean Rx-Fat Loss is not a prescription product. It is a dietary supplement made with the highest possible quality standards. To nutritionally support healthy weight management, take 2 tablets daily. For Clinical Strength Activity, promoting reduced cravings and successful and sustainable fat loss, take 6 tablets daily. For best results take with juice or water, and not with high protein foods." - Nature's Plus

"Say Yes to Dairy is a maximum strength digestive aid designed for temporary relief from the discomforts of lactose intolerance following dairy food consumption. Each chewable tablet supplies highly active lactase enzyme in a delicious French vanilla base. Even if you consume the healthiest diet imaginable, there can be no transfer of nutrients to the cells of your body unless food in the digestive tract is broken down properly.

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)

Why is it necessary?

"As a dietary supplement, alpha-lipoic acid appears to help increase insulin sensitivity, and may be especially useful in addressing metabolic syndrome. In addition, ALA works with other antioxidants to help neutralize free radicals and reduce cellular damage. It also acts as a synergist with B vitamins to help in the production of energy from the proteins, carbohydrates and fats consumed through foods. Researchers have investigated the use of alpha-lipoic acid in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, liver ailments and glaucoma. It may improve memory via its protective effects on brain and nerve tissue." - (Updated by: Andrew Weil, M.D., and Brian Becker, M.D., on Sept. 7, 2012)

Sunlight is not necessarily harmful all the time. The best way to obtain Vitamin D is directly from the sun!

Especially so for office workers, instead of always staying indoors, go on out and get some sunlight on your skin. Well of course, if you really can't do that on a regular basis, it is good to have a bottle of Vitamin D to supplement your body.

In the past week, it has been a common sight on the MRTs to have people coughing and sneezing, seems like there is a bug going around quite strongly. It does make you worry about your own health when others are not taking steps to prevent spreading of their germs, doesn't it? For personal and public hygiene, do wear a mask if you are unwell especially in high density areas, and carry around a hand-sanitizer!

What else can you take to protect your health or to get over the colds? There are many options available!

1. Olive leaf extract (liquid/ capsules) - 
One of the best things that your body will thank you for! Suitable for long term use, it has the active ingredient of oleuropein to support immune building in our bodies. Good for prevention! Suitable for kids ages 2 and up, and adults.

2. Black elderberry extract - 
Snaps, you've got the cold! No worries, black elderberry extract to the rescue! On the onset of cold, start yourself on some of these great berry extract that works on strengthening your immune cells, and fights off future colds, too! Suitable for kids ages 1 and up, and adults.

3. Vitamin C - 
The good ol' vitamin C, you will never go wrong dosing up on vitamin C! There are many forms of Vitamin C available in the market, but for a buffered/ non-acidic form, look for the calcium ascorbate form of Vitamin C. For all ages!

4. Home remedies! 
For the home makers, you might want to keep this home recipe for days where you just want to make your own remedy! Easy and simple, no need to make extra visits out to treat the colds and flu.

Around 50 years of age, most women start experiencing menopause due to the decreased level of female reproductive hormones called "Estrogen and Progesterone". Menopausal symptoms include hot flashes, insomnia, irritability, depression and headache. However, intensity and duration of the symptoms may vary among individuals.
Taking herbs and dietary supplements such as chasteberry, black cohosh, omega 3, evening primrose rose and soy is one of the best ways that women can consider besides estrogen therapy to treat the menopausal symptoms.
