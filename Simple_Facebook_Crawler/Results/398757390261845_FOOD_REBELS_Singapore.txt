Did you know that besides the food we eat,the water we drink, the products we use, our trapped emotions can also have a negative impact on our health. 

Trapped emotions can cause disease to take hold in our bodies. 

Anger, regret, frustration, sadness, lack of confidence, envy, jealousy, etc. 

Do not allow your thoughts to control you. After all, they are just thoughts and thoughts can be changed.

More on the need for us to control the water we drink and cook with on a daily basis. 

We cannot rely on anyone to make sure that the water our body needs to function at its optimum level, is safe. 

Our health is our responsibility. No one else's.

Video by Dr. Leonard Coldwell on R.O WATER.....so if our World Class Water Specialist cannot convince you, then maybe a Top Notch Medical Doctor can ;)

There! A non-biased professional advocating Reverse Osmosis drinking water. 

So many people are willing to eat almost anything without checking its source or what ingredients have been used. 

Or question whether the food they are ordering is going to have a negative effect on their body or health. 

But when it comes to water, suddenly everyone becomes a water expert and nutritionist. 

We can survive without food but we cannot survive without water. All the functions and processors of our bodies require water. 

Our blood is 98% water. 
Our body is 75% water. 
Our bones about 13%.
Everything in our bodies, require clean, pure water in order to function properly. 

Our bodies cannot process inorganic minerals. This is in the majority of mineral water. BPA plastics (Plastic Bottled Water) causes Men to develop 'Man Boobs' in the long run from whatever the effects are.....go RESEARCH please :)

And let's not even get started on the tap water. CHLORINE and FLUORIDE taken in large quantities (over many years) can cause Infertility issues....hmmm sounds familiar???

How do we remineralise our water with organic minerals that our bodies need? 

We do it by adding a tiny amount of Pink Himalayan salt. Not because this video says so, but because that is what we have been doing for some time. 

We need the trace minerals for our bodies to function properly. 

We also obtain our minerals from the food that we eat. Hence, why it's important to make sure we eat a wide variety of fruit and veg daily, together with essential fat, etc. 

PM us for the same REVERSE OSMOSIS_Water Purification System that we use for ourselves, our Birds, Aquarium Fish and Cats! Discounts given to ALL our Members!

We'll give you a fantastic TDS water testing advise session if you order from us today. We were taught by World Class Water Specialists and we know what's best for your family's HEALTH :)

The best way to stay healthy and disease free, is to avoid anything that can compromise your immune system. 

The 80/20 rule is a good guide to follow. 

Ours is more like 90/10.  Our choice and we don't feel like we are missing out on anything, because it's all about mindset as well.

When we do eat something outside, we pay for it later. 

Our bodies just crash. Our brains can't function efficiently and we are sluggish for hours after. 

Hence why we keep it to a minimum.  Sometimes it's hard if we have to be out all day.

However, we plan ahead.  We bring as much food as we can carry with us, so that we don't have to eat much junky food while out.

Don't be ignorant.  Sadly, this applies to many.

Especially those who refuse to see the truth, even if it is laid before them. 

Why?  Because they have a set of beliefs that they refuse to release.

Because they refuse to be open. And because they would rather stay in the 'familiar discomfort', rather than to make a little effort exploring alternatives. It takes work, which many are unwilling to do.

Please don't be fooled by the advertising of 'all natural', 'no additives', 'no artificial flavours', 'no artificial colours', etc.

I think we are all intelligent enough not to believe the hype. 

Not saying to give up ice cream altogether. Just be aware of what actually goes into them and to have them as the occasional treat. 

We have ice cream once every 6 months, maybe. 
Unless we can find organic coconut ice cream with no added sugar and only 4 ingredients on the label. 

Nutritional information is very misleading. 

ALWAYS read the ingredient label.

A little info on ice cream today. 

Why? Because I got a hilarious text from a client yesterday. Well, I think it's hilarious.

This client had her wisdom tooth extracted yesterday. 

Ouch! Not fun.

As you all know, the dentist will give you local anaesthesia, perform the extraction and routinely give you antibiotics to 'prevent an infection'.
 
I refused the antibiotics when I had mine done 10 years ago. Took organic oregano oil instead, Vitamin C, echinacea and some other natural immune boosting remedies. 

Anyway, on to this lady again.  She was 'advised' by the dentist, to eat ice cream because he said that her 'blood sugar is low'. 

Factory made ice cream, even those that declare natural ingredients, are far from the truth. 

Firstly, while ice cream can raise blood sugar, it will be a temporary spike due to the added sugar.  Your pancreas has to work extra hard to produce insulin to reduce that spike. 

To increase blood sugar levels, one needs to consume foods that do that naturally without the rapid spike. Foods that are low GI, for a gradual release that does not stress the pancreas. 

Secondly, added sugar will impair your immune system  for several hours after.  The very same immune system that has to repair the area of tooth extraction and prevent an infection from developing. 

Please remember that the majority of people in the 'sick care' industry, do not get training in nutrition. If they do get any training, it is less than 24 hours and the training they get is so basic and outdated, that they are actually, potentially putting people's health in jeopardy. 

So what can you have instead of ice cream? 

Food based Nutritional Supports and real food.

Can't bite or chew?

Make a fruit and veg based smoothie, using either fresh coconut water or purified water as a base. 

Add some raw, steel cut oats for sustained release.

This is what one needs after a tooth extraction, not ice cream. 

Still want ice cream?  Make your own without sugar. Use pure maple syrup, dates or pure date syrup to sweeten.

I bought pure, natural and organic products for them instead.

This is the scary bit. 

Because many doctors will give the wrong nutrition advise to patients. 

Real life statements by doctors:
- no raw salads or fruit while on chemo
- only thing to avoid is condensed milk ( advise to a diabetic patient)
- Vitamin C cannot help a sore throat
- you can eat whatever you want (advise to a cancer patient) 
- don't exercise (advise to another cancer patient)
- and countless more 

These are ALL wrong. 

The right foods can heal and reverse almost ALL of today's chronic conditions. 

Together with exercise and the right mindset.

The lives of a Holistic Chef and Life Coach....letting go.

As Holistic Chefs, we realise that ultimately we are human beings. We have our ups and downs and we are emotional creatures created by the 'Universe' (self-interpertations welcomed..). Life is beautiful.

However, we have learnt recently the power of 'letting go'. Letting go of material things that only sit in our closets either collecting dust, negative energy or worse, both! 

So we've decided this week to support a Charity Organisation (Muhammadiyah Association) with bedsheets, good quality clothes and more....about 20kgs worth! We hope to see their faces smile with our tiny contributions. Every small cause of giving just warms our hearts with more LOVE...

We are all 100% responsible for our health. 

We cannot expect anyone to do that for us. 

Doctors cannot keep you healthy. They are trained to recognised and treat symptoms. Not the root cause. 

And the majority of conventional doctors do not get any training in nutrition.

As a Functional, Holistic and Integrative Health coach and Chef, I am consistently learning new things to help those who seek the natural route to healing and staying healthy. 

Being intuitive is also very important. 

I am so grateful to have had the great privilege last Sunday to spend a whole day learning and listening to a professor in Integrative Health & Nutrition.  For free.

He is also a Fellow Associate of the American Academy of Natural Medicine.

An expert in nutrition, anti ageing and preventive health.

Is the Academic Director of the Centre of Integrative Health and Wellness.

As much as I have learnt over 20 years, and have knowledge in, there is always something new to learn. 

 Natural health is also very logical. Which sadly, many do not adhere to. 

Our bodies are remarkable 'machines'. They can keep going for many years, being fed on junk.  However, our bodies will give up one day, if we do not listen to the messages they send us. 

The chronic fatigue.
Headaches or migraines.
IBS (Irritable Bowel)
Candida
Infertility. 
Hives.
Allergies.
Cancer.
Asthma.
Arthritis.
Dementia.
Parkinson's 
And a whole lot more.

Some of the biggest contributors to our ill health are insufficient pure water and stress.

Genetics play a very small role in many things. How we live our life on a daily basis is crucial to our overall health and happiness. 

We have to learn different strategies to keep ourselves grounded and as stress free as possible.

And today, we will be attending another short intro into how to eat with physical pain, naturally. This one is not free.  A small token for the privilege is worth it. 

Another thing we are grateful for.  

If you too, would like to learn any of the above, for yourself or your family, do PM us.

This is so unbelievably true. 

We have had people say, in the past, that our clean foods (zero additives, hormones, antibiotics and many organic options), are too expensive. Base price $14.

But they drive Mercedes, Audi, BMW. Handbag is Prada, TODs, etc. Purse is Kate Spade or Prada

Have the latest iPhone and iPad or MacBook.

Somebody please explain the logic.

Seems like many are just concerned about looking good from the outside and have little concern about what they consume on a daily basis. 

They also take better care of their car, than they do themselves.

It's probably time for us to get back in the game. To actually cook and create the best and most creative fusion meals the nation have ever tasted and experienced! 

We're talking about friendly, tasty and clean everyday functional meals for people to enjoy! What do you think? Should we look for a place and start our magic once more?

Anyway, today was an interesting day! We were invited to judge the best meals created by different teams from a 'Masterchef Cooking Bootcamp' corporate event in a team building setup earlier! Surprisingly, some of their meals were pretty yummy (but not sure how it'll taste without the monosodium glutamate empowered stocks though hmm...). To have fun is most important.

The Prawn Dumpling Soup, Avocado Mousse on Gula Melaka and the Poached Salmon with Spinach and Lemon came out tops! KUDOS to the winning teams ;)

The state of our world today. Too many of us have jobs that require little movement. 

Sitting for hours on end.  After the job, we sit for hours on end with our smart devices. 

We need to get moving again. The least amount of steps that we need to be walking everyday is 10,000.

Know what the average number of steps a person walks today? 2,300! 

So a good start is to just get walking. Start with once a week, if you have done nothing for a while.  The build it up slowly.

This article advocates counting calories, however not all calories are created equal. 

Just because something is 200 calories, does. To mean that it is better for you. 

Take two muffins for example:

One is made with regular flour, sugar, egg, etc.  This has 250 calories.

The other is made with sprouted whole grains, nuts, seeds and fruit. This one is 400 calories.

If you missed the last screening of The Truth about Cancer, please catch this limited FREE screening. 

It's very informative and shares why the conventional treatments, surgery, chemotherapy & radiotherapy, are far from effective at curing cancer (except for the very rare blood cancers).

Cancer occurs when the immune system is sleeping. 

Several factors can put your immune system to sleep.

- stress
- environmental pollutants 
- diet
- lifestyle 
- mindset
- vaccines 
- nutrient deficiency

Cancer can be reversed through natural means. 

The immune system needs to be woken up, in order for it to fight the cancer.

Nature has provided us with everything we need to stay healthy and to heal ourselves of all ailments. 
From cuts, scrapes, and wounds to tumours, cancer, MS, Alzheimer's and more. 

We have become so disconnected with nature, that we have forgotten most of what of our ancestors used frequently. 

With the rise of modern technology, much of the active compounds from nature has been isolated and made more potent without destroying its essence with artificial additives. 

By harnessing the power of nature, we are actually making our bodies stronger by enabling it to function at its optimum level. 

Together with real food, proper food based Nutritional Supports, adequate sleep and exercise, we can be disease free, slow down the ageing process and not allow ourselves to be dictated by what has become 'normal'.

If you eat eggs from unhappy chickens, the eggs are not going to have any kind of health benefit. 

Same goes with ALL animal products. 

I really hate calling them products because animals are living beings. 

Everything is made up of energy. And if the energy of any animal is negative, that energy transmits to us. 

This is not hocus pocus. This is real. 

Ever walk into a room and felt that the energy was tense? That's what we mean. 

The same applies to everything. Even inanimate objects. They absorb energy.

Many think that being a vegetarian or a vegan is extreme. 

Have you ever thought about how extreme the way meat is 'produced'? 

Have you ever considered the a,punt of stress the animals are under? 

Have you ever considered, 
- what the animals must be feeling, being confined 24/7? 
- Being fed on an unnatural diet for the whole of its short life? 
- Being consistently fed antibiotics that inevitably end up in us? 
- the impact that industrial animal husbandry is having on this planet?
- that all the grain that feeds all these animals can actually feed the world and wipe out hunger?

Very few people look at the bigger picture. 

We share this planet with other living beings, that have just as much right as we do, to a full, happy, free life.

Antibiotics are being prescribed for every little bug that flies around. 

Please note that antibiotics do not work on viruses. Colds and flu are viruses. 

Antibiotics are for severe bacterial infections and other secondary infections. 

Not only that, for those that eat meat, especially not organic meats, they are exposing themselves to small doses of antibiotics that are routinely fed to animals. 

How does this affect us?  Antibiotic resistance. 

This is a potentially fatal situation because if you really need antibiotics, you may find that it doesn't work because you have built up a resistance to it. 

Build your immune system up naturally. Don't rely on antibiotics at the first sign of a fever or sniffle. Let your body heal naturally.

The pineal gland. Almost no one knows about this or what it's function is. 

For those who are into spiritual awakening (not to be confused with religion), you need to watch this. 

Our pineal gland has a much bigger role to play in our overall wellbeing, besides awakening our subconscious mind. 

Spirituality aside, how we live on a daily basis can also affect the pineal gland.
- fluoride
- Mercury
- processed foods and drink
- too much meat
- a sedentary lifestyle
- inadequate sleep

This is so true. 

Many who complain about how much organic food costs, often forget how much they pay on a regular basis for their medical bills. 

Please don't forget that you don't need to buy organic for every single ingredient. 
Just for the ones that are the most heavily sprayed. 

And you can also purchase a Plasma Detoxifier, that will effectively remove waxes, pesticides, herbicides, bacteria, etc. Very economical in the long run as it also  keeps fruit and veg fresh for longer.

We get this question all the time.

'How about fish? Fish is healthy.'

Farmed fish is NOT healthy. Like the vast majority of animals reared for human consumption, they are kept in cramped conditions, fed on a totally unnatural diet laced with antibiotics and are generally sick and stressed. 

Tilapia is a plant eating fish. This is not what they are fed, when farmed. 

Technically, tilapia would be a healthy option if caught wild from unpolluted waters.

Some people would ask me... "Hey Chef, why don't you drink Mineral or Alkaline water? Why just PURE water? So here's my reply...

1) Water is NOT food. So you can never get enough minerals from just drinking water. Do we ask for protein, carbohydrates or EFAs when we drink our water? No. So why demand for minerals when only drinking your water? :) 

2) Alkaline water is probably a marketing ploy for these companies to take your money away from you. It doesn't matter if you drink alkaline water as the moment it enters your mouth, it turns ACIDIC. Why? It's coz our mouth is acidic! So is our stomach and our skin! :) 

So where do you get your minerals and vitamins from? Eat these instead! Fruit and vegetables....and of course, natural or organic. I am as passionate about Clean Eating as much as I am about Clean and Pure Water ;)

Not graphic at all. Just the truth behind animal agriculture. 

It has become a business for profit with no regard for the feelings of other living beings. 

Just put yourself in that position. 

How would you feel if your babies were taken away from you at 1 day old?

How would you feel if you were confined 24/7 in a space so cramped you could not move? 

How would you feel if you never felt the sun on your face, the grass beneath your feet, the wind in your hair or the rain? 

How would you feel if you had nothing to eat and drink but dry biscuits and water till the end of your days? 

How would you feel if you were forced to get pregnant? 

How would you feel if your fingernails were pulled out? (This is what baby chicks feel when their beaks are clipped off.)

We are not extremists. We are not insane.

Those that put millions of living beings through this hell, day in day out, are. 

Be mindful and conscious of what you consume on a daily basis. 

You don't have to be vegan. Just choose better.

What we are saying is that we all need to be 100% responsible for our own health. 

We can prevent chronic illness and disease through changing:

? our diet
? our lifestyle
? our mindset
? our dependence on technology 

It is not as hard as you think it might be. Just change one thing a day or weekly. And before you know it, you will have changed most things to benefit your overall health. 

Do feel free to PM if you need more help :)
