salam! smile ????

I am a korean who is interested in muslim and Islamic cultures!
 thesedays I've seen so many muslim travelers in korea. But I got found the travelers were having slight difficulties since there are a few facilities for muslims such as praying room, Halal foods etc.
 So I want to be a help for them who travel korea.
 and Finally me and some of my friends made a group which is called Salam Korea.
 I hope you could interested in it!
 and there is something I want to ask for~
 Actually, I will VISIT malaysia, singapore and indonesia for sightsee and search about some facilities for muslims since they are muslim countries~
 If is there any group or organization that valuable to visit, 
 PLZ recomment~:-)

sincerely, sunny from korea:)
