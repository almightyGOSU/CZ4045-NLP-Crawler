Dear friends of Zhen Zi, 

It is with a very heavy heart that I am writing this post. Especially to our 58 facebook supporters and all those who love Zhen Zi, please accept my deepest apology.

We have decided to close off our outlet at toa payoh on 14th December due to the losses we have incurred from its operations. This is largely due to:

1. The high food cost associated with producing our quality prawn soup (boiling over 20 hours with fresh prawn head etc.)
2. Relatively low selling price as a percentage of food and production cost
3. Moderate sales volume
4. Staffing problem due government change in manpower policy

We are vurrently re-visiting Zhen Zi business model and will keep all informed of any decision.

For your information, our company  (Peddler Sidewalk Group Pte Ltd) also owns the brand Malaysia Peddler Sidewalk and we hope to receive your similar support.

Thank you! 

P.S. Malaysia Peddler Sidewalk outlets are located at V Hotel, Yishun Block 233, Simei MRT,  Tampines Mall, Tampines Mart, 
NUH and Greenwich.

Thank you to Princess J for her very candid but frank comments on www.hungrygowhere.com "...their noodles actually needs no promotion. It's very good".

We have been running promotions as we are confident of our delicious prawn soup and would like more customers to be aware of us. But such comments are extremely motivating for us to do even better for you! 

Thanks a million!
