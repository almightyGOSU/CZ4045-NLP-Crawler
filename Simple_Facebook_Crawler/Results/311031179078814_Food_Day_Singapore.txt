::Cepat Dimasak! Sedap Dimakan!::

Do you know that Malaysians consumed 870 million packets of instant noodles in 2004? 

The amount is expected to increase to more than 1,500 million packets by 2015! 

Why Instant noodle is SO SEDAP? 

Because there is 136 additives in instant noodles! 

Out of the 136 additives, 24 of them are sodium salts, besides table salt which is also added.

High sodium intake raises high blood pressure. It also creates other health problems like stroke, atherosclerosis, fluid retention, swollen ankles, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Meniere’s Syndrome, Premenstrual Syndrome, glaucoma, osteoporosis, kidney and bladder stones, stomach cancer, enlargement of the heart, rigidity of large arteries and asthma.

Say “NO” to this junk food now!

How many of you are committed to say "NO" to this junk food but not sure how?

::Colours of The Rainbow::

Ever heard of the rainbow diet? It's not an actual diet.... 

Basically, you just choose fruits and vegetables of every color in the rainbow.

Do you know eating the full rainbow of foods regularly helps give your body the nutrients it needs?

In addition to fiber, vitamins and minerals, naturally colored foods contain what are known as phytochemicals. 

These powerful nutrients acts as the body's soldiers to fight dieseases! GOOD OR GREAT?

::SO MISLEADING!::

It says 'NO ARTIFICIAL COLOUR and NO ARTIFICIAL FLAVOUR on the Campbell Mushroom Soup Food Label..... 

But try reading the Ingredient List.... you will find Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)

Do you know what is MSG? 

MSG is one of the WORST food additives on the market and is used in canned soups, crackers and, amazingly, even in baby food and infant formula.

MSG is more than just a seasoning like salt and pepper, it actually enhances the flavor of foods, making processed meats and frozen dinners taste fresher and smell better, salad dressings more tasty, and canned foods less tinny.

In short, don't know how to cook? Just put Ajinomoto ~ MSG! Voila your dish becomes YUMMY instantly!

Are you a HUGE LOVER of BIG MAC?

Big Mac is one beloved meal staple that has a long standing on the McDonald’s menu, no matter what country you’re dining in. If you’ve eaten a Big Mac, however, you might not be aware of everything that made that burger happen.

Do you know that you're eating 1000 cows when you're eating Big Mac?

WARNING FOR MOTHERS: Beware of Franken-Food

Do you know that Sand is added to our Processed Spices, Saw Dust in our Ice Cream, Duck Feathers in our Bread?

WHY? Because the food industry wants to make their Processed Foodstuff look better, taste better and last longer.

It is our responsibility to learn to read Nutrition Food Labels and pick up Nutrition tips for our own family's health

I seriously think that everyone must be educated about food!
Food Education MUST be taught in schools, not only exclusive for those who opt for Home Econs/ Food & Nutrition modules.

I remembered asking the kids who attended my Food Revolution Kids workshop recently, 'What is your favourite vegetable?'
Some of them replied 'French Fries'...

Oh my goddddd!!! Something is not right somewhere!

We have to do something about this issue, especially when statistics show that kids obesity is on the rise!

By the way, this is my Nutrition mentor in the picture below. She is a Celebrity Nutritionist, has appeared on Channel News Asia and given talks on Secrets to be Slim & Sexy for the last 10 years or so!

Good or Great!

Get Food Education in Every School is a national initiative created by Food Day and the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation to raise awareness about the critical importance of food education in schools across America.

It provides a chance to start talking about how food education should be an integrated part of the school curriculum, and that hands-on cooking and essential food skills should be taught to every child, at every school in the country.

If every child had the opportunity to learn about, grow and cook food and understand the implications of food waste on the wider community, we believe they’d have the knowledge and tools to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Studies show that:

The more children learn about food and nutrition, the more likely they are to eat fruit and vegetables.

The more children cook and prepare fresh food from scratch, the more likely they are to appreciate healthier and more varied ingredients.

The more children plant and harvest fruit and vegetables, the more motivated they’ll be to eat them also.

Food Day inspires Americans to change their diets and our food policies. Every October 24, thousands of events all around the country bring Americans together to celebrate and enjoy real food and to push for improved food policies.

October 24 is a day to resolve to make changes in our own diets and to take action to solve food-related problems in our communities at the local, state, and national level. In 2014, Food Day will have a special focus on food access and justice for food and farm workers.

This annual event involves some of the country’s most prominent food activists, united by a vision of food that is healthy, affordable, and produced with care for the environment, farm animals, and the people who grow, harvest, and serve it.

With Food Day, we can celebrate our food system when it works and fix it when it’s broken. Across the country, more than 4,700 events took place in 2013 and 3,200 in 2012, from community festivals in Denver, Savannah, and New York City, to a national conference in Washington, DC, to thousands of school activities in Portland, Minneapolis, and elsewhere.

Why Food Day?

The typical American diet is contributing to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems. Those problems cost Americans more than $150 billion per year. Plus, a meat-heavy diet takes a terrible toll on the environment.

Eating Real can save your own health and put our food system on a more humane, sustainable path. With America’s resources, there’s no excuse for hunger, low wages for food and farm workers, or inhumane conditions for farm animals. 

Join the Movement 

The most important ingredient in Food Day is you! Use October 24 to start—or celebrate—eating a healthier diet and putting your family’s diet on track. Food Day is not just a day; it’s a year-long catalyst for healthier diets and a better food system. Let’s use this energy to make a meaningful and long-lasting difference!
