With the crunchy teppi ( blowfish skin), makes me want to have a mouth full! 
And with the salty seasoning , it is very scrumptious and appetizing! 
Feel your body getting warmer during the winter with its blowfish steamboat. 
steamboat = nabe in japanese.

But once i looked out the window, i saw the trees and roofs covered in snow, a breath taking view and i felt refreshed and eager to do well in all aspects this year!

?????????????????????????
Thank you.

Hello and Good Afternoon!

???????????????????????????????????
?????????????
?????????????????????????????????
How is everyone doing? The weather in Kyoto is getting colder by the day. 
Which makes it the best time to run some errands in the house. 

????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????(^^)
I heard that Singapore is having their usual heavy rains at the moment. 
So please take care so that you guys don't catch a cold

??????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????(^^)
But, if you do get a cold, there's nothing better than a hot green tea to cure it. 
Japanese green tea contains catchin which helps kills bacteria. 
Matcha latter tea also contains the same element. 
Therefore in a cold and rainy day like this, we can kick back and relax with a body 
warming Japanese tea.  

???????????????????????
I hereby wish everyone a healthy and prosperous day!

??????
Goodbye..

Look at this sun rise!! Beautiful isn't it? 
It is nice to wake up early sometimes.
And have a deep breath.

Last couple of days, it was unbelievably hot like mid summer.
But it's still only in June.
Rainy season  is just started in Kyoto.And temperature drop down again.
Summer time is over there soon to come to Kyoto.

Taste like coffee but smells like matcha.
If you want to try something different today. 
Easy to make one at home.
1, make a cup of coffee.
2, add pure matcha powder.

Have you ever drank a cup of Shincha?
During spring time, we pick only young tea leaves and make tea which is called Shincha.
It has great flavor than regular green tea. 
We believe drinking Shincha makes you healthy.

Daifuku is used to be only one kind such as sweet beans in rice cake. Now we have many kinds of it.
This one on the picture I ate today was blueberry and cheese in rice cake. 
Can you imagine?
Incredibly match them. Taste like in between Asian and European sweets.

I show you "Today's Kyoto".

I went to tipical Japanese(Kyoto style) restaurant on Kiyamachi St in city. It's a sukiyaki restaurant called KANOKO. 
Old traditional Kyoto recipe of sukiyaki is that adding only soysause and demerara sugar. And Japanese beef, local vegetables and tofu etc. 

It's very delicious!!

KANOKO staff will look after your meal whole time with you.
I promise, They will provide you a wonderful time.

Famous river side terrace tables are opened until end of Sep.
Why don't you come to Kyoto and try this sukiyaki?

????/Matcha Latte

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Matcha is a powdered green tea.
Green tea has caffein, catechin, vitamin-C, dietary fiber etc.You will be able to take everything by drinking Matcha much more than brewed tea..
Our Matcha Latte contains two times more Matcha than others.
Try the real taste..
