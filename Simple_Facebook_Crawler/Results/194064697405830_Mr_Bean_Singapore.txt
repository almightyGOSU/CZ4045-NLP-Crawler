Also, your service standard at Raffles Place is worse than 2 years ago. Been asking around all over the place. It is because you pay the girls base on customer's order that is why they are rude and even recklessly throw coins over the table and on top of the food.

We often take our smiles for granted, but did you know that in Asia, an estimated 100,000* children are born each year with facial deformities such as cleft lips and cleft palates?
 
Mr Bean, partnering with “The Smile Mission” and “Smile Asia”, hopes to change the lives of these underprivileged children and provide free surgeries to repair cleft lip, cleft palate and other facial deformities for children across Asia. These deformities are often life-threatening and emotionally traumatizing; many children are unable to eat or speak; some are even kept out of school.
 
Here are some ways you can contribute:  
1. Make a donation at the donation boxes in any of our Mr Bean store 
2. Send a cheque to “The Smile Mission Ltd” and post to 352 Tanglin Road #01-05, Tanglin International Centre, Singapore 247671. Quote “Smile With Me” on the reverse side of the cheque.
 
Make a child smile today with a little generosity! :)

By default, The Smile Mission Ltd will expend proceeds from this campaign on sending medical volunteers from Singapore to surgical missions across Asia, and other related local expenses.

I prefer no promotion price . No promotion price same place order taste very good. So thick the taste. Very nice. But one day i buy the promotion price at $ 1 . I really regret buying. So thin n waterly. Why i know ? Because i order without sugar. If i order with sugar, i surely cannot know whether is thick or thin. I order without sugar, i immediately can feel the thickness in my mouth. Very little taste of soya at all. Water taste. Very regret buying. People say cheap is no good. Now i believe cheap really is no good. I prefer to pay $1.50 than to pay $ 1 for a taste of water and not soya bean.

Clarification required 

According to SG50 Seniors Package, seniors aged 60-64 are eligible to enjoy a special deal at Mr.Bean. The requirement was "Just bring along any photo identification e.g. NRIC, Senior Concession Card or Pioneer Generation Card for verification to enjoy your offer."
Since my Mum enjoys Mr.Beam?I brought her to the a/m outlet on 28Jun15 with the intention to redeem the offer.However we we rejected by th counter staff who insisted my Mum had to produce a "purple" Senior Concession Card and did not accept pink  NRIC as a form of verification. The staff claimed it is "company instruction". 
I would like to seek clarity as to whether this is true.

Just went to your causeway pt stall with my dad (64yr old). For SG50 promote beancurd of $1. He show his snr card, but your staff say only for those with pioneer card. Which is for 65yr old last yr. However, i  SG50 for senior promote. You actually publish for 60 to 64yr old cat. So can you breif your staff accordingly. As it was not so nice for us to argue with your staff for your promote.

I was at Bukit Panjang Plaza this morning at 9.35am hoping to purchase its anniversary celebration deal of a cup of soya milk at 20 cents. However I was utterly disappointed that all 200 cups were already sold out. Considering that the offer started from 9.00 am, how could it be possible that the limited stock could be gone in half an hour.

Bought a bowl of beancurd from the Sembawang Sunplaza outlet on the way home but only came home disappointed when I opened the packet and saw how crumbled and broken my beancurd was. I did not watch the person serving my beancurd as I trust Mr Bean to always deliver good and fresh beancurd but this was utterly disappointing to come home to. The whole cup was crumbled beancurd and it was not enjoyable at all to consume it. I am questioning if it is the standard of Mr Bean's beancurd that is compromising or just the service and standard of Sun Plaza's outlet. If there weren't anymore proper beancurd left, I rather I be told that there isn't anymore left than be served this.
