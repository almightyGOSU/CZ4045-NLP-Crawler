Eat nuts as a simple healthy snack, sprinkle on yoghurt, granola and add a little wholesome crunch to your salads.

Of course, you can also get naughty with some pistachio and rose  muffins too ;)

Time to bond and share about the day.  It's a great way to spend top quality time as a family.  If you can't manage this every day, make a goal this year to do as often as possible - maybe , once a week?

If you can build in the time to cook the meal together…even better!

Fresh fruit served with coconut ice cream ... Strikes chords of a pavlova, just lighter and healthier.  

Delish ?

Am not the biggest fan of quiche but I felt like I needed to "create" something today ...

So, today's experiment is an olive oil pastry - filled with spinach, goats cheese, pine nuts and red pepper.

Super scrumptious salad dressing - my first time using orange juice ... Serving with deep green salad leaves, toasted pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, roasted asparagus and broccoli/ alfalfa sprouts ... 

Sounds a little heavy on the ingredients list but less than 20 mins prepping... Really!

Today I went to the very first Kranji Countryside Farmers Market here in Singapore . 
It was really amazing, fabulous crowd, vendors , whole street lined with fresh local vegetables, artisan spreads, teas ,Asian inspired granola , chilli and many more. 
One that stood out was Plant Visionz and I was privileged to have a mini chat with Hendrik Kwan , its Principal Horticulturist. In this video he shares how Jamie Oliver inspired him and what table farming is all about. 
Do check out Plant Visionz at http://plantvisionz.com

At home this weekend, we've been celebrating Food Revolution weekend with home comfort foods from the UK… 

Good old spaghetti bolognese and chocolate banana loaf  

The choccie banana loaf contains a cheeky little Asian twist…can anyone guess what it is?  
Hint.  Small, red and packs a nutritious punch)

We're always talking about REAL food but this often means different things to different people.  
There are so many conflicting stories about what's good and what's not and it all get so confusing...

Here's a book that is small enough to quickly digest (yes, pun intended ;)) and beautifully lays out the basic guidelines to eating well.  

Good solid common sense, excellent food knowledge with a dose of humour.  

Ps.  No, I don't have shares in the company, nor am I related in any way to Michael Pollan ...I just think that everyone should read this...

What a great way to celebrate Food Revolution Day 2014!

Over 80 enthusiastic children were shown how to make fresh pasta, taste fresh sauces and vegetables and learn about growing their own herbs.   

Fantastic food spirit from the awesome team at Jamie's Italian.

Get cooking!

Happy Food Revolution Day!

Ditch the packets and reach for the salads.  

Shop from the outer aisles of the supermarket and buy produce that's been grown on trees and from the ground.

Eat real!

We all know that real food is much healthier... but, let's not forget that it's also much tastier!

And real cheese doesn't get much tastier than the ones specially brought in by the Cheese Ark.

To celebrate this year's global Food Revolution Day, our friends at The Cheese Ark,  are offering a very special promotion to encourage Singapore foodies to eat REAL cheese (no, those singles sheets are not cheese!)

20% discount off select cheeses (see attached post) until the end May 2014.
Just flash the logo to get your very special cheese at a very special price.
