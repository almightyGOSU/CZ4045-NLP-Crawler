Shermay's Singapore Fine Food featured in http://www.stylexstyle.com/editorial/lifestyle/10-best-artisanal-foods-try.

"For a taste of Singapore’s best loved flavours without the hassle, you’ll love this range of convenient ready-to-eat condiments, such as chilli sauce, and marinades, such as bak kwa (sweet barbequed meat). The condiments are made according to family recipes by food consultant, Shermay Lee. Her first sauce, Cilicuka (a chili vinegar dipping sauce), was based on her Peranakan grandmother’s hand-written recipe, which is more than 40 years old."

Our Cilicuka is a universal chilli sauce, which means it goes with just about anything! It is halal and non-GMO. It has no MSG, artificial colouring, emulsifiers and stabilisers. 

It has very high vegetable content which makes it more expensive to make but also better for you. No cheap fillers, like starch and sugar. We made a product we believe in; plus, it's proudly made in Singapore!

Old photos of the Peranakan granny whose Cilicuka recipe is the one you are tasting. Mrs Lee Chin Koon (Chua Jim Neo, 1907-1980) being inducted into the Confrerie De La Chaine Des Rotisseurs Singapore in 1976. Chaine is a male society of professionals and gourmands, they made her an honourary member. Mrs Lee also launched Lai Wah Restaurant in 1970. This is part of Singapore's culinary history and heritage, from a bygone era.

Did not manage to find this famous cilicuka last time until they were handcarried all the way from Singapore and luckily now they sell it in CKTang ?? Honestly, it is sooo good and goes well with everything, from crackers to emping, from fried fish to yutiao or even drenched it over glutinous rice dumpling for that extra kick ??

Making our own popiah at The Clifford Pier as local F&B personality Shermay Lee (@shermayssingaporefinefood) returns to share her passion for Singapore’s culinary history this August. The SG50 Menu is a mixture of Peranakan, Cantonese as well as Indian influenced dishes that would have been part of many Singaporean families’ home-cooked meals over the years. These familiar comfort dishes include Shermay’s grandmother’s (the late-Mrs. Lee Chin Koon) signature popiah served in traditional fashion where ingredients are presented on a platter.

The Peranakan style popiah platter uses delicate egg skins to encase slow-cooked turnip, julienned cucumber, lap cheong, bits of hard-boiled egg, coriander leaves, crab meat and prawns with tim cheong (sweet sauce) and Shermay’s signature tangy Cilicuka. It’s unique to see egg skins because we usually have rice skins at popiah stalls. The braised turnip has been cooked with pork belly, prawns, bean paste and simmered for about an hour, hence you get a richer flavour. 
Shermay Lee’s SG50 Menu is available from 1 to 31 August 2015 for lunch and dinner. Read more about it: http://www.misstamchiak.com/clifford-pier-shermay-lee-2015/

You heard it here first: #Laksa #Bouillabaisse. My conception of a Luxe-sa! A luxe version of laksa, lah! 70% seafood, 30% carb, swimming in a lighter brothy laksa gravy. Laksa gravy is based on granny's recipe (as usual): made-from-scratch using her 50 yr old recipe. Straight-up. Classic. No faffing about.

Enjoying my Friday to the fullest with oysters and bubblies ???. Fresh shucked oysters from St Vaast, paired with Champagne Taittinger Brut Reserve, accompanied by 3 Asian dips (@shermayssingaporefinefood 's Cilicuka with calamansi, chilli-lime dressing and Singapore brewed black vinegar with red shallots). I usually have my oysters with just lemon, but they were actually perfect with the Asian condiments, especially that Cilicuka ? Tangy and spicy which brings out the sweetness of the fresh seafood. #Perfect

When Ed went back to Singapore earlier this month, I had few special requests. One was for a huge bag of dried anchovies (aka ikan bilis), so that I can use them with abandon rather than worry about making my precious (and exorbitant) stash last. I couldn't think of a better way to break open the bag than with a comforting bowl of ban mian for me, and mee hoon kueh for Ed. There's something therapeutic about kneading dough, especially after it has had time to relax into a soft but elastic ball. I feel like I could do this everyday. And yes, that is a bottle of #Cilicuka that is finding its way into probably too many of our meals.

Our #Cilicuka is now served on our national carrier, Singapore Airlines. An authentic, traditional, and historically significant, Singaporean chilli sauce served on an award-winning airline. Cilicuka, calamansi lime and keropok udang, are just some of the Asian comfort foods chef and food consultant #shermaylee put on the SG50 menu for SQ.

Spotted! Our jars of #Cilicuka at The Fullerton Hotel's Cake Boutique - and they have just lowered their prices! The same Singaporean chilli sauce now served at The Clifford Pier. This makes them our only retail outlet in the financial district, which is convenient for last minute gifts. Goes into a nice Fullerton Hotel paper bag too!

Yay! #Cilicuka made it all the way to Cambridge, UK! First was London (see our earlier posts), then Buckinghamshire, now Cambridge! Where ever there are Singaporeans, Malaysians and Indonesians, you'll likely find a jar of Southeast Asian chill sauce appear at the table! We love our spice!

Wondering what to bring to a homesick friend living overseas? Shermay's Cilicuka might be your answer. Thank you @dukeljonel for this gift, among the many others in your expertly curated SG50 funpack. I was over the moon, and so was Ed when he pulled out that bottle of Cilicuka for lunch today. I've a feeling it won't last us a week! ? It was definitely spicy enough for our chilli padi-loving palates, with just the right amount of tang. Sure beats that (still precious) packet of fresh chilli padi we smuggled over here.

50 Singaporean food and drink gifts
Show love the Singaporean way to friends and family – show it with locally made foodstuffs. Here are 50 gifts you should present:

"CILICUKA | Singapore cookbook author and cooking-school owner and instructor Shermay Lee has launched her product line of heritage sauces and marinades. Created based on her grandmother’s handwritten recipe, the cilicuka is a versatile red chilli sauce that has moderate heat with a refreshing and tangy vinegar flavour. Use it as a dipping sauce for noodles, rice, and any fried savoury snacks, or put a dollop over kueh pie tee (pastry shell filled with cooked radish and prawns) and popiah (radish roll). Make your own variations of suaces by squeezing in some calamansi juice, or stir in some chicken stock to serve as dipping sauce for Hainanese chicken rice. Lee also sells a bak kwa (barbecue pork) marinade. The cilicuka is available in Classic ($9.95) and Extra Hot ($10.95) her website (www.shermay.com)."

Dinner last night :: Love how easy it is to whip up a quick meal with @shermayssingaporefinefood Spicy Bak Kwa Marinade and Extra Hot Cilicuka. 
Boneless skin on chicken thighs, marinated with Spicy Bak Kwa marinade, shaoxing wine, garlic and thinly sliced onions that caramelise so sweetly on the grill. Springy egg noodles tossed in #Cilicuka, Sesame Oil, Ginger-Scallion Sauce and Thick Dark Soy. 
Have a delicious weekend, dear friends!

This is what goes into our #Cilicuka: sun-ripened, big, juicy and red South East Asian chillies. Washed, stems removed and ground to a coarse paste which best replicates homemade. We use no fillers (starch and excess sugar), which is why our product is #glutenfree with no artificial colouring and MSG.

Popiah party! First time making it at my own home. Didn't bother too much about the exact ingredients, just wanted the family to have a fun hands-on lunch by wrapping their own popiah?. Though the kids didn't make the prettiest looking ones, they had fun! Happy weekend meals with the whole family is the best??? #honeybeecookssimplelunch #honeybeeweekendmeals

Historic moment here: #Cilicuka in the blue tupperware for Business and First Class (to be transferred into a porcelain bowl), and in solo cups (individual cups) for Premier Economy and Economy Classes for SQ passengers. 
We hope you'll enjoy the taste of an authentic Peranakan chilli sauce 35,000 ft up in the sky, on board the award-winning Singapore Airlines!

Still craving this red fish curry, and the best nasi kuning I've had in years at The Clifford Pier on Thursday. This is part of a menu put together by @shermayssingaporefinefood, referencing the cookbooks of culinary pioneers like Leong Yee Soo (Shermay's grand aunt), Lee Chin Koon (her grandma) and Ellice Handy, the ex-principal of MGS. Time to go book hunting again I think! (Sorry Nick...)

Do you know how to roll your Popiah correctly? @shermayssingaporefinefood showed us how. Fold up from the bottom and roll it over slightly to tuck the Popiah skin beneath. Then, fold the sides in and continue to roll your Popiah forward and away from you. It's a lot easier with egg skin, with the firmer and stickier texture! Featuring 8 dishes based on recipes by iconic cookbook authors of Singapore, Shermay's Singapore Culinary Grande Dames menu will be available at The Clifford Pier from 1-31 August.

Trying to get some inspirations during lunch time while reading through the two copies of "Mrs Lee's Cookbook"(?????) Loving the Nonya Cuisine copy which has a very nice collection of peranakan recipes. 
Hopefully I can cook some soon?. Cooked Minced beef fried rice for the kids since they love any form of fried rice? Hearty and satisfying, my kind of comfort food. Best with that #Cilicuka from @shermayssingaporefinefood ? Happy lunching guys!?? #honeybeecookssimplelunch

This is what a passenger told us, if you ask for our Cilicuka on-board Singapore Airlines, you will get it as of 1 July 2015. They might have to take it from Business Class. If don't specifically ask, they will likely only give you their standard sachet chilli sauce.
