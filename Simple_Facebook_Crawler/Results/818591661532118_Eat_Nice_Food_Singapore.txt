Whoaw, such a huge prawn.... 

KENG ENG SEE seafood is a popular place around Alexandra Village. The way they whip one of their signature drunken prawn with herbal is pretty smooth. Not until you place them in your mouth, it is as if you have reached nirvana. Prawns are fresh and huge compared with most eateries. Highly recommended for dinner with families.

Before the showdown of countdown at downtown, it is wise to pop by Shiraz Mazzeh Gourmet Kebab for some kebab galore for dinner. Perhaps the more affordable beer in the area to quench your thirst. 

Beckoning the New Year 2015.

Out of options? Not sure where to bring your clients or suppliers to have a high-end Western food in Singapore? 

Skirt steakhouse is a fantastic place for down-2-earth yet fabulous top edge meal. Apart from their immaculate food presentation, the quality of their steaks is also worth a kill. Suitable for couple seeking cosy and romance ambience. 

However, you need to make reservation with them two weeks in advance for weekend dining & one week in advance for weekday.

Have you ever tried authentic local Vietnamese Cuisine?

Long Phung restaurant is considered as one of the yummiest Viet you wish to indulge in Singapore;serving majority of popular Saigon style Viet food (rated by a group of my Vietnamese friends). Their price is reasonably affordable as compared to other franchise Vietnamese restaurant such as Wrap & Roll, Nam Nam Noodle Bar. Do take note to come early if you decide to pay them a visit as the length of the queue can be erroneous.

Are you a fan of Steamboat Buffet?

It is rare to witness such a restaurant that offers fresh ocean catches like the one in M Hotel. We could consume up to 3-4kg of crabs with huge pincers. Tiger prawns, oysters, etc are equally delectable. Plethora choices of meat for Carnivores. Their desserts worth a steal too especially the Durian Mousse.
I will definitely come back to steal those catches again!

Talking about Crab dishes in Spore, we normally mention about Chili Crab, Pepper Crab, Salted Crab or Butter Crab. But have you ever tried Pumpkin Crab?

I found it at Chin Huat Live Seafood @ 105 Clementi street 12, S120105

Something is really different for Crab dishes in Spore, you also can see many actors, actresses ate there before which showed on screen
