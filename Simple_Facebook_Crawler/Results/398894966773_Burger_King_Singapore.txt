My Mushroom Swiss was major depressing, it was exactly like a mcdonalds cheeseburger, i think BK needs to start looking into their QC seriously if one of their long time signature burger looks like that after unwrapping.

This is the 4th consecutive time that my BK order was delivered wrongly. The first 3 times my mushroom swiss tendergrill burger is changed to normal tendergrill burger for no reason and today they left out the chicken salad.

I've already posted the photos and feedback here before but BK has pretended not to see my post.

It seems like they are really determined to get my order wrong, or they are just out to make us get less than what we paid for.

I hope to receive a proper explanation this time.

I am very disappointed in the delivery services. I've tried through my phone and it direct me to food panda just 5 mins before my checkout it says it's available to deliver to my address upon wanting to make payment it's unfortunate that they can't find a restaurant near me. why? so I tried the second option to call and I waited and waited for exactly 8 mins waiting for the song to end and someone to pickup my call and guess what? the computed voice pickup and say goodbye and I was engage!

Dear Sir,

The sign outside the Burger King store at Tampines Mall advertised the various floats available at the store. I queued up to purchase one, and while in the queue I could also see the floats being advertised at the counters. 

However, after queuing up for so long, when it was my turn to order the float, I was told that the ice cream was not available, hence there was no float. 

If float or ice cream is not available, then the advertisements should be removed. I queued up for a long while only to be utterly disappointed when I was a the counter. The server did not apologise to me. Instead, I was only informed that "ice cream is not available today". 

And this wasn't the first time it happened to me. Something should be done about how the outlet is run at Tampines Mall so that customers like me will not suffer queuing up for so long and get disappointed in the end.

6 out of 10 times when I tried to order for delivery, you have "down-rider" at the Tampines North CC outlet. 
There is no Sjora mango peach available for delivery? Why is it always out of stock 100% of the times when I did manage to place an order? 
You advertise Minute Maid Refresh as a non gassy drink. But the drink always comes gassy. Tastes like Fanta orange if you ask me. 
I very much prefer BK than Macs. I hate to have to order from Macs just because you cannot deliver. Please work on it.

Burger King Singapore I was here at Bukit Panjang Plaza outlet (630pm+,10 aug)  and was told that theres no more soft drink for my sets due to machinery breakdown. Then I was asked to top up money to get coffee/tea which is something that I do not drink. So peeved off that I just left to have Mcdonalds instead. If you can't offer the drinks that come with the set, at least offer an alternative that has equal pricing to the set drinks and not tell your customers that they have to top up for a set!

There are three people serving  and only one counter opened for us. 
 The queue was 45 minutes long in the outlet at ECP  and as seen from the reviews from different  people on fb ,  this is not the first time . You should expect more crowd on a public holiday  .

Even though it's all burger king, I would like to commend the burger king at toa payoh central. My burger actually have a generous portion similar to as advertised unlike at woodlands mrt where the patty is dry and the onion chips in the cheesy turkey bacon burger is so little that I can hardly see them. The onion rings at tpy is very nicely done as well. Would definitely visit many times in the future.

Its my first time using BK delivery service and it utter crap. I ordered at 12pm via food panda. 10 mins after the order was confirmed they called up and told me that they had a rider shortage due to peak lunch hours and can only arrived at 1.30pm. I was cool with that arrangement as i knew that i had ordered at a bad timing and hence i waited and waited till 1.45pm. When no food arrived, i called up again to check with food panda to verify with BK call center and guess what? My food is not with any rider and the lady proposed that my food should arrive in another 30mins which will make it 2.15pm.
 
I've order fast food a few times but delivery of 2 hours and 15 mins is a record high.

Dear Burger King,

At about 10:30 this morning, my colleague bought this croissan'wich from Esplanade exchange #burgerkingsingapore. It is mouldy. When she apporached the counter, there was another angry lady infront, dicussing this same situation with the counter staff. Counter staff told her that this is due to the wrapper, and mentioned that has not expired referring to the packaging, regardless, shouldnt the kitchen staff had picked that up with their eyes? This is very obvious! (no filter picture attached)

UNACCEPTABLE AND ATROCIOUS SERVICE!!!

This is my very first experience using BK Delivery Service and positively the last. I have ordered a doubles Fish N Crisp meal online. The item that arrived an hour later was a single Fish N Crisp. 

I called the BK delivery hotline and the Customer Service Officer tells me he will have to call the outlet to see if they can arrange for a re-delivery of the right item. In the meantime, I am told to NOT consume the wrong item. 

Basically, they think that it is reasonable for them to get the customer to wait for at least another hour for a mistake that THEY have made. Should I choose to consume the wrong item, they will send me a $5 voucher instead. I opted to wait for the re-delivery as I do not foresee myself using BK delivery for a second time.

He confirms my request and says he will call me back after he checks with the store.

It has been 30 minutes since that call and I have yet to get a call back or any sort of update at all.

An attempt to use their live chat is just as useless. CSO informs me that he will get the outlet to call me. After 10 minutes and I ask him what's the update - he says: "They haven't called you?"

Finally after 40 minutes, the same CSO calls me back to say they couldn't reach the outlet nor the rider, so it is unfortunate that they have to give me a $5 voucher instead (after making me wait this entire time, not being able to consume my food!)

Once again, I refused the voucher - evidently I am have no interest in using BK delivery again. I asked to speak with a manager to ask for a full refund.

She finally offered a partial refund that was fair and the issue is resolved - but I just wasted 40+mins and now my food is cold and I no longer have any appetite left.

BK Delivery / foodpanda or whoever these guys are... please get your act together.

Dear BK-SG

Please refund my order "s8qf-h5nm/2"

Very disappointed by the service that was given to me by your staff at Cathay Cineleisure Orchard. They served my drink with a broken cap and because of that, it spilled all over my hand and on my phone. When I went over to the ordering counter, your staff gave me a look as though it was my fault that the cap broke. I already inform them that it overflowed but your staff didn't even offer me any napkins. What kind of service is this? Is your staff going to be held responsible if my phone receives any water damage?

Hi, I just want to tell you how much I am disappointed with the outcome of me answering your survey. Last week, I have answered a survey that was written at my receipt. Then, I received a code which I can use in claiming the supposed freebies(if i'm not mistaken, a french fries and a coke.). Then, when I was to claim it today(July 13 at woodlands MRT Burger King), i was being asked to pay SGD2.60 for the coke and the only free item given was a french fries..Imagine, just a regular coke for SGD2.60? I should bought other items instead of availing your promotion..I have learned my lesson. next time, i will never trust your promotions.

Hi Burger King. I made an online order for my family yesterday and it was an extremely unpleasant experience. The order was placed at 5.15pm and shortly after, I received an SMS confirmation with the expected delivery time said to be at 6.15pm. After so much waiting and until it was time to break our fast, the food was not delivered at all. Only at about 7.30pm, I received a call from your call centre and learnt that our order was not processed due to technical difficulties with the ordering system. It was disappointing that we were not informed of this earlier. I refused to wait another hour for the delivery at that point and requested for a refund in the end. Completely unreliable.

Hi Burger King..i juz ordered for breaking fast @ 5.20 pm and the order came real promptly after 1 hour. HOWEVER, this cheesy burger of urs was missed. Dats ok cos i tot i merely have to call to get it delivered but guess wat ur customer service mentioned? Re-delivery is another 2-3 hours time. 

First time we settled for BK delivery and it is so disappointing in service. According to the customer service guy, Mac, u guys are short on riders from Tampines North outlet hence the recovery only 2-3 hours later for your very own mistake. I should have stuck to ordering McDonalds cos even if there is required service recovery, turnaround is within 30 mins.  So, please keep your burger as I am only keen to have my money back. And do work on timelines better!

Today is the 2nd time I tried ordering online for my fast-breaking 

First order was on 27 Jun.  Called in at 530pm n at 6++pm the staff from Sembawang Shopping Ctr branch called in to inform that they can only send in my order within 1.5-2 hrs time due to overwhelming orders 

Today, call was made at also 5.30pm as instructed by the CSO.. requested that we pre-order n for our order to be sent in at 7pm but officer said that cant be done.  Insist that we call in by 5.30/6pm. Did so at 5.30pm earlier on n now at 6.15pm we received a call from sebawang Shopping Ctr that our order can only be sent in 2 hrs time. 

THIS IS TOTALLY ABSURD & UNACCEPTABLE.

NOT ONCE BUT TWICE THIS HAPPENS TO ME!!!!!

CSO should have checked with the restaurant before proceeding with out order....  n 2hrs is way too long....  if they say within an hour, we can still consider.

Very disappointing as I have always waited for BK to come up with delivery n when it finally does, this happens.....

I had a terrible experience today with bk ssc branch. I reached the outlet at and started queueing about 10:15am. I only managed to receive my partial order by 10:55am. There were only 5 customers before me but the queue was not moving. 

The only counter staff was not attending to the line all the time and was busy preparing the drinks and waiting for orders to be fulfilled. 

To my horror, I saw an elderly auntie, a young man and the lady manager struggling to get food served. A crew of such size should've been able to serve 5 customers within 5 mins. 

Apparently the manager was busy preparing for lunch to be served. The young man was making breakfast only upon order! I have no clue what the elderly auntie was doing as she was walking up and down. There was an elderly uncle who was clearing trash and entertaining deliveries.

There were so many people waiting behind me, many left halfway. There was no priority in who should be doing what. The manager was not taking charge of the shift and everybody was left to perform on their own. 

I'm amazed that the young man was cooking breakfast only upon order. He was cooking beef patties ONE AT A TIME and was struggling when orders came in. 

I was left standing the whole time at the counter to watch the whole incident. Customer service was very poor, it seemed that we were expected to wait at the counter.

While waiting for my order, another lady was told that she had to wait 30min for hash browns for her kid as they have ran out of hash brown and have to "go upstairs" to bring then down. I was shocked to hear that from the manager.

I'm also quite stunned that the queue trying to get breakfast had to change their orders to lunch halfway. There was simply no sense of urgency or were the staffs apologetic towards the customers.

I understand that this is a small outlet but the service standards of burger King shouldn't be like this. It is still quite vivid in my mind as I've never encountered so disappointing service.

I do not wish for the staff to get k to trouble but hope to see that the standards improve. I hope bk can look into this as it is quite serious.
