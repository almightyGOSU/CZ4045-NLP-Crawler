We join our nation in mourning the loss of our Founding Prime Minister, the Late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and thank him for building Singapore to where we are today. His fighting spirit will certainly remain in our hearts, allowing us to continue developing the essence of a nation, a nation where we will be committed, sincere and live with integrity as one united people. 

We will carry on his legacy to build a forward moving democratic society and many generations will learn of your dedication and sacrifice. Thank you Mr Lee.
