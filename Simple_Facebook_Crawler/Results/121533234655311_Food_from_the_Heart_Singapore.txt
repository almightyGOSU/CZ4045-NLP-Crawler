Indeed, wasting food is equivalent to wasting money. But the problem is even bigger than we think. As consumers, let us do our part to change the situation.

Sometime last week, Food from the Heart (Singapore) received a donation of $1,500 from Mr & Mrs Tang on behalf of baby Charlene who has just turned one! Her parents decided to donate angbao money from her first birthday to FFTH's Birthday Programme so that the less privileged can enjoy birthday celebrations as well. How wonderful is that? Choose to give back to society with this wonderful possibility! Hashtag #50waystogive and inspire others to do the same :) #celebrategiving

Thanks to Zengkun from ST for covering the F&B food waste survey! 

As mentioned in the article: "Food and beverage companies should be proactive in addressing consumers' interest and reduce food wastage. One of the things they can do immediately is to donate unsold food to charities such as The Foodbank Singapore and Food from the Heart (Singapore)."

We saw 

1. Donors from age of 8 to 80 donated generously  today
2. Many smiling volunteers supported by playing music and attracting  attention, packing and selling goodies, arranging  logistics and approaching  donors to make them aware about the cause
3. Moms giving coins to toddlers to put in donation boxes and teaching them about joy of giving - Thanks to all such Moms
4. A toddler made her Mumma search for wallet in 3 handbags for 5 minutes and waiting so  impatiently so that she can donate :)
5. Many people approaching us to make sure they understand the cause before donating - The Alert donors

The charity drive will continue  tomorrow as well at Tampines MRT

149 food goodie bags packed for Food from the Heart (Singapore)'s beneficiaries this afternoon! 

Each month, NYC staff are encouraged to volunteer one afternoon to pack such food goodie bags to benefit the lower income families and elderly who are living alone - The volunteers will locate and pick the food items within the right weight range from the warehouse (the food items come in all shape and sizes), and pack them into individual food goodie bags that can be stacked up for distribution.

You too can organise your own group of at least 8 persons to volunteer at Food from the Heart! Do give them a buzz to offer your help :)

Students from Canadian International School visit FFTH for a volunteering opportunity, helping to pack food goodie bags and wrap presents for the festive season! Indeed the greatest gift you can give someone is your time. :)

In support of Food from the Heart (Singapore) (FFTH), Mandarin Oriental, Singapore has been donating unsold bread and pastries daily to FFTH. Most recently, our enthusiastic colleagues gathered at the FFTH warehouse to pack goodie bags to be handed out to the needy. Committed to helping the disadvantaged in Singapore, FFTH is a welfare organisation that helps to provide essential food items and other rations to beneficiaries on a regular basis.
Mandarin Oriental, Singapore is certainly proud to be part of this programme in paying it forward. #CSR
