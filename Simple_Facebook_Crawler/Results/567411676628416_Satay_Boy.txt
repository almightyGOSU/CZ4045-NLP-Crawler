Selamat Morning! Its still early in the morning and we are at it again. This has been a trend this year, us waking up pretty early to ready our satay and wings. You must be thinking, who eats satay at this time? Well this order like many others in the morning are for open houses. So if you have an open house planned, you can order from us and we can deliver to you!

Whatsapp 96904269 to place orders.

Salam #foodlovers

Raya is just around the corner and we must always be prepared for those unexpected guests (not the floating kind guys... i'm referring to "Saya dah on the way ni ke rumah awak" type of guests).

So, to prevent us from having panic attacks(the "Alamakkkkkk,nak masak ape ni!?!" kind of attacks)... why not store frozen Satay Goreng in our freezer?

Saves us the headache and our precious time which we could use it to speed clean our homes!

As usual, contact us at 9690 4269 for further details and to order.

New on our menu for kids. Seaweed chicken as an add on for your own combos. 
Well we know its for kids, but its still very tasty for adults. Admit it, you stole some from your kids plate before... haha.

Just imagine mee soto with seaweed chicken.. so sedap!

Maybe thinking of getting hotdog and fishcakes.

#SBmeerebus with Tongkeng ayam. Available till Sunday 16/03/2014
Our Tonkeng Ayam are boiled in our Soto Soup. We then mix them with some secret spices and fry it to get them crispy brown.
Crispy on the outside, soft and yummy on the inside!
Salivating yet?

Today we are ready to serve you with our #kicktotheface or #KTTF spicy wing.
We amped up these bad boys with a whole load of fresh chilli padi. 
We came up with this level of heat as some customers want some kick in their wings. 

If this is still not hot enough, we are prepared to kick it up with more heat to knock you out!
