NUS UTown has an excellent upcoming restaurant called The Royals Bistro. Enjoyed their Meatball Linguine ($11.90+) and their Prawn and Mushroom Linguine ($11.90+) was pretty good as well. The Smoked salmon Caesar salad was decent though it could pack a better punch in flavour. Still, a very decent place to check out.

Lunch at Marutama Ramen restaurant! Okonomiyaki is pretty decent, with flavorful egg and cabbage. I enjoyed the classic ramen, and the ajitama tamago is one of the best I've had.

Excited to see McDonald's latest introduction - "create your taste" burger. 

Mine was a semolina bun, guacamole, creamy garlic aioli, wild rocket leaf, whole leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, double angus beef patty, Swiss cheese, caramelised onions and grilled mushrooms. 

$11.15 for the burger a la carte. 

Verdict: juicy and delectable burger and something I'll come back for. Though a long wait at the sun plaza outlet (they just opened yesterday), I have to say this is McDonald's redefined.

Note: the burger is not on their wooden plank serving plate as I wanted to takeaway but grew hungry waiting and just decided to eat in.

The 11-course Omakase meal features a glimpse of Executive Chef Takuma Seki’s ingenuity on bridging quality ingredients at reasonable prices. With traditional delights like Chutoro, Uni, Miyazaki Wagyu Grade A4 appearing on my menu, I was certainly pleased by the range of ingredients harmonised together for a unique experience that is certainly different from the regular. And with this course appearing for an attractive price of $138++, I am definitely seduced for a return visit.

The general dining experience at Ginzawa is intended for the diner who wishes to indulge in a collection of quality dishes that range from both the traditional to the contemporary. Although pricier than the standard Japanese fare, each dish advocates a certain degree of the Chef’s skill and the freshness of premium ingredients used. However, while there were standouts for me like the Tokusen Hokkai Chirashi Don and the Kurobuta Braised Pork Don, I thought a little more work needs done with the Uni and Anago Tempura.

Immerse into a glimpse of Kyoto Cuisine at Tampopo Singapore from 7th – 11th February! The Kyoto Grade A5 beef was definitely stellar for its price but the bigger draw for me would be the Kyo-Yuba that has distinctly left a memorable impression with me. It is the first time in which Tampopo restaurant is bringing in a Kyoto Fair and it might pay to drop by for a visit.

The Lawn at the Biopolis is great for those who are in the area looking for a selection of salads and meats to go along with it. While it is not the first salad bar on scene, its unique dressings stand out from the rest. I loved the food but little else can be said for the decor that seems catered for a quick come and go crowd.

Takumen Ramen Gallery at Raffles Place is one store that will compel me to make a return visit over and over again for their authentic Japanese ramen. During my visit a couple of days back, I had the honour to go through all six ramen variants available at the restaurant. I was impressed with each one available, with some like the Hajime Tori Paitan Ramen leaving a distinct flavourful memory or the Chibakara Jiro-Inspired Ramen for their portion sizes.

Even today, each puff is still handmade with tender loving care and stuffed with ingredients ranging from their popular Chicken Curry to caramelized onions and sardine paired with slices of chilies.

My visit to The Waterfall has been nothing short of a pleasant memory revisited. While the dishes may have changed slightly over the years, I’m glad that certain favourites are still kept on the menu. Dishes like the Watermelon Salad, Corn Veloute and Roasted Salmon are my must have dishes during my return visit. Its dessert selection is simple yet exquisite. While I still have fond memories of stronger and more complex tasting dishes a few years ago, the overall dining experience at The Waterfall is still definitely more than the food itself. The locality, charming atmosphere and warm hearted tenderness of the place, make this a recommended place to dine at for that special occasion.

The Penang Hawkers’ Fare Buffet at the York Hotel is a legacy in its own right. With its inception in 1986, the Penang Hawkers’ Buffet is currently in its 28th year. Held approximately two to three times a year with the Penang Hawkers invited in each time, this is one buffet spread with a selection of 10-11 authentic Penang dishes that is probably the closest you can get in Singapore without having to visit Penang itself. Available during both lunch and dinner, the Penang Hawkers’ Buffet is on a first-come-first-serve basis with no reservations allowed.
