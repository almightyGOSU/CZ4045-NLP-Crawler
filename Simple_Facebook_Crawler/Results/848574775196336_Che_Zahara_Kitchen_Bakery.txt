We hope you’ve been enjoying your Hari Raya weekend! If you haven’t had the chance to taste some of our delicious Raya goodies, you can try your hand at making one of our favourites, the Kek Mamar (Marble Cake). 

Our favourite entrepreneur and celebrity chef Rita Zahara shared this recipe during the launch of her first book, Malay Heritage Cooking, but we have to warn you first: It tastes best straight from her kitchen ;)
