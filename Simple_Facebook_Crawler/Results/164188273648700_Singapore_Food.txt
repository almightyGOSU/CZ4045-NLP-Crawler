Visited nex pratawala nth time.

Ordered plain dosai and butter chicken.

Billing: rocket price.
It's ok , as long as price is worth, no issue.

Delivery: dosai is served chill. It is supposed to be hot. 
Coconut chutney: spoiled , eating spoiled chutney will cause health problem. I looked around, some tables got dosai and some of those dosai tables got children too.?
Chilli chutney : consoling ly better . I can finish dosai with it?.
Butter chicken : good.

Worst part is that I feed backed to them every time i visit that coconut chutney is spoiled and dosai is chill. Seems they never mind.

To start restaurant , employees must pass food handling exams. I wonder , what ever I complaint here can be escalated with basic food handling and QA.

#Madamkwan #vivocity  i have visited 3 times earlier. I remembered this place every time I #Crave for #bojari #currychicken , only be coz of good food , friendly service and cleanliness. Today myself and my foodie friends decided to never return to  this restaurant. #rudewaiter and #unclean utensil caused our decision .

Nothing beats the feel-good, get-together spirit of a community aka the kampung spirit. And the Singapore Democrats want to re-kindle that very Singaporean tradition.
That's why we warmly invite you to join us at the Kampung Kook-Off on 25 November 2012, Sunday, in a first-ever, fun-filled food-fair.
