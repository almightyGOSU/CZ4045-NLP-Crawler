Good Afternoon:)
Welcome to this new page, it will take you into different views of Singapore.
 Let’s take a look at this new open garden located at Marina bay. Garden by the bay was built since the earlier June 2012 and it became tourist spot to attract foreigner for sight-seeing.
It is a very romantic place for couples to take a stroll as the night view is very spectacle. 
 The natural environment attracts both the local and foreigner. At least 300000 members of the public visited the bay.
