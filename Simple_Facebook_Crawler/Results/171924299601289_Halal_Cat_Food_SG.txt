Would appreciate it if you could share this with all fellow com cat lovers! Just to inform all you cat and animal lovers out there my book in English "Memoirs Of A Community Cat" is now available in all 4 (Orchard; ?iang Court and Bugis and Jurong)  Kinokuniya bookstores. 
Please go and browse and lend your support as part of my small royalties will go back to the community cats (mostly in donations to the food fund of feeders who badly need help) for whom this book was written. 
This book gives the com cat a voice, a story to tell and hopefully will bring them closer to the community they live in because they have no where else to go... Thank you!

This is the display at Kinokuniya Takashimaya at B03-03 and Kinokuniya Bugis Junction Lifestyle If its not on the shelf just reserve a copy with bookstore staff they have plenty of stock in their warehouse. 

It is also available at Meowmi Cat Café 668 North Bridge Rd. Please help support that café café because the owner so kindly donates 10% of all their sales to Yishun 326 Tabby cat. 

Overseas readers can purchase it at this link on Amazon.com:

Thank you!
