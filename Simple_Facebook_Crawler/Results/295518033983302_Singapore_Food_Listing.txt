Old School Delights Milkshake at Benjamin Browns Bistro & Bakery

Fun, nostalgic and colourful. You could see the sparkle in people's eyes as this cloyingly sweet dessert come to their table. There are so many toppings that you dont even know where to start from. Enough said, just try it for yourself.

Berry Ricotta Hotcake at Curious Palette

With Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Seasonal Berries, Pumpkin Seeds and Sunflower Seeds

The assortment of colours and embellishment of the hotcake and vanilla ice cream with icing sugar, purple floss sugar and lavender flower extract gives the delicacy a sweet and sacchariferous demeanor. The pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds provide the variation and balance to the overall toothsome flavour. To nitpick, a more generous serving of mixed berries will take the dish one step closer to perfection.

Squid Ink Tagliatelle with 'inferno' sauce, calamari, asparagus & chilli padi at Open Farm Community.

The insatiable appetite for gorgeous food masquerading as cookbooks and recipes has indeed proven the old adage right: We eat with our eyes. 
The bright and daring colours of the red inferno sauce being smeared on the distinct black squid ink tagliatelle creates a picturesque dish. The zesty and acerbic flavour stimulates your sensations for each bite that you take and leaves you craving for even more.

Where to eat at KL?
Lets try this lovely cafe which is located on Jalan Sultan and sharing a building with the Grocer’s Inn.
The signature dish of The Front Door is the scrumptious open-faced sandwiches of multiple flavours. It is a good place to relax and wind down after a day’s walk in Petaling Street.

Address : 78, Jalan Sultan, 50000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

24 hour Stewed Beef Cheek with Espresso at Curious Palette

Espresso Sauce, Portobello Mushroom, Cherry Vine Tomatoes, Artichoke, Petit Salad and Sourdough

When the beef cheek is cooked well, the fat gets broken down making it slightly gelatinous, basically meaning that it melts in your mouth. This dish passes the test with almost nonchalant ease.

The expresso sauce permeates the beef cheeks and there is an incredible depth of flavour and a gorgeously soft texture.

Happy midweek! Crave sweets under pressure? There's a reason: Sugar suppresses the stress hormone cortisol. But! It leaves you hungrier. Stop the cycle with snacks high in fiber, fat, protein, and other soothing benefits. Try these!!

Yawn at work? A cuppa will be the best gift for me right now!
In Jimmy Monkey Café & Bar, their baristas actually take a good amount of time every morning, sacrificing their liver and sanity, calibrating your coffee for that perfect balance of flavour.
It's not "just a cup of normal coffee".

British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver opens their second restaurant in Singapore at the heart of Orchard Road. 

A buzzing and stylish yet cozy space, Jamie’s Italian Forum at Orchard evolves throughout the day. In the morning, pop in and read the papers over a freshly ground coffee and one of our Italian artisan pastries. Drop by for a quick lunch or an early evening meal before a movie – one of our fantastic thin-crust pizzas, or a bowl of fresh pasta and a colourful side salad. The bar is perfect to unwind after a hard day at work with our Aperitivo Hour, or for a bottle of wine and some tasty nibbles with your friends after a weekend shopping spree. Whatever the occasion and time, Jamie’s Italian Forum at Orchard will always be a great place to meet, socialise, eat and drink.

Queen's Garden is editor's top favorite café in Singapore. I just had high tea this late afternoon and could not wait to share with you all.
I just love the beautifully decorated setting and I always have an enjoyable meal there.
The food is authentic and delicious and the prices are reasonable for the portion size.

Psst.. Green Tea-nie was off-the-chain! It is my usual pick! It is Saturday. So forget about the diet and indulge in sweet, yummy desserts!

Grilled Hanger steak at By The Fire
Charred Onglet Steak Served with Sauce, Shallot Confit and Crispy Potato

Hanger steak also known as onglet steak in France is usually the most tender cut on an animal and is best marinated and cooked quickly over high heat and served rare or medium rare to avoid toughness.
The steak here is succulent, luscious and its own rendered juice is still dripping as I gorge voraciously on it. The poor crispy potato ends up being the neglected sibling while the elder brother basks in his glory. A definite must try besides their scotch egg.

{Recipe} Breakfast Pizzas

Tomatoes make this recipe fresh and delicious, and they also are packed with cancer-fighting lycopene.

PREP TIME: 10 minutes
TOTAL TIME: 20 minutes
SERVINGS: 4

5 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
4 oz packed spinach (4 c)
2 (6-inch) whole-grain pitas, halved horizontally
2 lg plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
4 lg eggs
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 oz reduced-fat feta cheese, crumbled (? cup)

1. HEAT the oven to 450°F.
2. HEAT 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add spinach, in batches if necessary, and cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. BRUSH inside of each pita round with 1 teaspoon oil. Place pita rounds, oiled side up, on a large baking sheet and bake until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.
4. DIVIDE tomatoes and spinach evenly among pita halves, leaving an empty space in the center of each for an egg. Crack 1 egg into the center of each pita. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, return to the oven, and bake until yolks are lightly set, 8 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and continue baking until cheese has softened, about 2 minutes more. Serve warm.

The Laneway Market

Twirls, Mirepoix Pain de Mie
The fanciful name of a French sandwich which consists of Mirepoix (selection of roughly cut vegetables) on Pain de Mie (white bread).
The salmon is slightly torched at the top and partially raw for aburi style. Apple twirls and smashed black olives add a layer of tanginess and gentle disarray to this creative piece of food art.

By The Fire
Breaded Minced Pork with Soft Boiled Egg served with Purple Cabbage Colesaw

A Scotch Egg is a delicacy that was made out of necessity in the Middle Ages by Scottish farmers and sheperds as a form of 'packed' lunch from home. In this case, the chefs at By The Fire use a soft boiled egg instead of the traditional hard boiled egg and coat it in sausage meat and bread crumbs before frying it. The result is a delicate and luscious scotch egg comfortably nestled in juicy, tender meat which makes it a truly scrumptious appetizer.

Buttermilk waffles
Premium New Zealand Natural Vanilla Ice Cream with Blueberry Compote & Strawberries
Delightfully crisp on the outside, soft and tender in the middle with a tinge of sourness and finally drizzled with the toothsome maple syrup, the waffle lives up to its hype indeed. DOC's choice of NZ Natural ice cream is astute. The consistency of the vanilla is pretty true to its immaculate creaminess.

Amidst the rows of residential housing and neighbourhood convenience stores, a sun-striped awning peeks out from around the corner, playfully inviting you to bring the good vibes in.
