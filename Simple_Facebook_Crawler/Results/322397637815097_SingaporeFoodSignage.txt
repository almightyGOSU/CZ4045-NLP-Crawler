Effective Marketing should tap more into Sell More and Sell it Fast.
In many respects, Sales would be smooth selling without Marketing who acts as a art of communication via value of the products or services you are selling.

Phocept have a client whose stall has opened 3 weeks ago without any advertisement (such as Food Images of what they are selling & Notification of their grand opening via flyer or banners to be display). Amazingly after print some temporary menu board to just display at the counter, people are start Queuing-up to purchase their skewers. Again, Marketing is important for every Businesses you are running now. This is the time, the time is NOW.
