Hi all, any one has any suggestions to built or to buy a simple self watering system for small potted plants? I'm traveling regionally quite often and sometimes for extended periods. So the dry spell we been having is taking a toll on my greens, rosemary and lemon balm. TIA.

Hey everyone, I am Linus Lim, a Singaporean student based in Tokyo right now. I'm doing a research paper on ongoing zero-acreage farming (farming within buildings) practices in Singapore. I believe many people here grow edible plants in buildings, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could spare 5-10 minutes of your time to respond to this questionnaire about growing edible plants within buildings, and share it with people you know who are doing the same. Please contact me through Facebook anytime if you would like to clarify anything!

Hi guys!
Wondering if any of you have faced similar problems before? So, we have been growing herbs from our HDB. Right now, we have sweet basil, thai basil, rosemary and dill. We grow them on HDB window ledges, which are very spacious and ample coming from an older type of HDB and there are no danger of potted plants toppling over. These are not in the common corridor but from our own window. However, I have had very zealous town council people coming to issue complains and taking pictures of my herbs, forcing us to remove them all, or face a fine and more.
My question is, how do we confront this very persistent and irritating problem? I thought that some of you many have some clue hence reaching out to you. Do you have similar problems as I?
Warmest Wishes,
Joel

Good day all, I see that there is a movement towards making your own compost, I have developed a product over recent years to improve soil by adding an enzyme to the compost, it removes the smell in under 5 seconds & assist in the decomposition stages, for instance raw chicken manure converts to compost in less than 24 hours, the smell reduction is also in less than 5 seconds, the nutrient levels increase significantly the results are fantastic, we have proven that completely organic does not mean small, in fact we grow monster veggies, the enzyme also kills cockroaches, plant lice & the little white fly, the white fly is a real pest in Asia, especially for tomato plants, the product is also used by the cattle farmers & pig farmers, it even helps for human faeces. 
Let me know if anyone here would like to try some.
Cheers & happy gardening
Chris

Here is a photo of the compost bin we made for our deck in Singapore. We now have two of these (1 per person). The time it takes to fill one tends to be enough to time for the other to compose (about 3 months). I pour the liquid out of the bottom bin once or twice a week, otherwise I do very little. Easy!

Hi all ! We are a little group of people working on a project, and we would like to know what you think about it, as we really appreciate what’s happening in this group.
It is at an early stage, but we will create a free online platform on which people will be able to share technical knowledge about organic food growing, thus creating a large, open and participative database. In a wikipedia kind of approach we want people to be able to upload knowledge themselves and make it easily accessible to anyone, through a well-thought search engine and system of filters. We will also create a “social network” aspect, enabling people to create profile pages, to share knowledge but also their own stories, their experience and achievements.
Our larger goal is to spread, promote and protect knowledge about natural food-growing, may it be traditional or result of research, or even personal experience.

Now, what do you think of this?
Would you be happy to see something like this exist? Or you wouldn’t need it?
And most important : what is your experience of growing food? (how long have you been doing it, where did/do you learn, why do you do it?)

We want to hear from you, as we think you have a lot to share! Don’t hesitate to share any of your your thought, might they be sweet or harsh to hear, we’re very open.
You can write in the comment section or send me a Facebook message.
Thanks a lot, we’ll be there to talk :)

"You begin to see that growing even a little of your own food is, as Wendell Berry pointed out 30 years ago, one of those solutions that, instead of begetting a new set of problems — the way “solutions” like ethanol or nuclear power inevitably do — actually beget other solutions, and not only of the kind that save carbon. Still more valuable are the habits of mind that growing a little of your own food can yield. You quickly learn that you need not be dependent on specialists to provide for yourself — that your body is still good for something and may actually be enlisted in its own support."
