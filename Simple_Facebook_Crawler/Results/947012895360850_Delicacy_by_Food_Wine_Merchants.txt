3 months back, we visited the Pascualete cheese caves in Spain and found these dainty Truffle Cheeses ageing with finesse. They are now ripe and ready to be enjoyed! Truffle Cheeses, Retorta and Cumbre Trujillo cheeses just arrived in Delicacy, and are waiting for eager tongues to savour their aroma and flavour. Come down to 10 Gemmill Lane and have a taste!

Thanks for the mention Mr. Stanley! The awesome sauce on the grilled prawns is cream soya with a secret touch; which Chef Victor has yet to reveal to us yet! Want to know the secret? Visit Delicacy and help us bug Chef for the secret!
