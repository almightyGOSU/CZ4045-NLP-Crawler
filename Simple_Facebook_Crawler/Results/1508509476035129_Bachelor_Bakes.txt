Sometimes, you just don't have the time to do the long winded type of Mee Kari.. So there's always an alternative way to do it as long as it fills the appetite.

Most importantly it's ikhlas..

Thank you for complying with my nonsense of a last min order for momsie's birthday and going the extra mile with the delivery as well. 

The Chocolate Tart was truly decadent and absolutely divine! It was meant for momsie since it was her birthday and all but it was kiddo and me who almost wiped up the whole shebang. We can't help but keep sinking our teeth in it for more. 

The smooth texture of the chocolate weren't overly sweet, the crumbly bits of the pastry were... Left mostly for momsie since kiddo told her, 

''Mak jgn makan manis², Mak da lanjut usia tak elok. Nie biskut dia tak manis sangat, nie Mak bleh makan'' 

Oh boy... Lol

Thank you Bachelor Bakes for creating something full of love that it shows through in every bite. Highly recommended y'all! 

Love, 
Sha

Surprise Surprise!

Last weekend, we received an order from our mutual friend requesting us to deliver the cake too for Sat - 30/8.

Upon delivering  to the address yesterday, I was surprised to be greeted by secondary school friends. 

Indeed it was a surprise gathering for our school mate Bday and she was equally surprised seeing me delivering the cake.

Spend a good hour with them chatting and catching up.

Lovely surprise ladies - and don't do that again please? I was in a mess! Hahahah :)

Psst: Oreo cheesecake gone within 10 minutes.

Thank you to Mrs Siti Aishah, happy bday to Mrs Suzana & her new bundle of joy and it's nice to catch up with all you ladiesssss!

Dear Friends,

Hope everyone is well and looking forward to the weekend.

Just would like to ask if BachelorBakes do up another round of cake tasting event, would you like to come? It's somewhere in Jurong though :)

The last event was before fasting month. We thought of doing another before December festivities.

What are your thoughts? Do share.

A like means you support the idea but if you don't, do share why not (aside from distance as a reason)

Look forward! 

Thank you!

BachelorBakes.

Dear friends,

The blueberry seasons will be over soon.
We have managed to grab and stock up on blueberry from most supermarkets and will keep them frozen. 

It's while stocks last.

Those who wish to order blueberry cheesecake or blueberry crumble, do place your orders to avoid disappointment.

We don't use from the can type. Just not our style :))

So look forward to your orders.

Lots of love
Bachelor Bakes
