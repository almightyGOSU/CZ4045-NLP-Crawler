Hello Friday! :) Got your weekends planned out? Some spa and massage to recharge for the coming week? Everytime I look at the photo below from the mountain resort, I just feel like booking a plane ticket there immediately.
On a side note, many of our customers often ask us about the name of the shop. 'Mae' stands for mum in thai and 'Noi' stands for tiny so 'Mae Noi' actually means 'Tiny Mum'. It is actually the nickname of the owner of the shop. 
By the way, we tweaked the lemon tea recipe so did you taste the difference?

Have a feedback? We'll be glad to hear from you :)

Have a happy weekend! :D

Good morning everyone! What a beautiful morning it is because it is FRIDAY! =) We have taken a long hiatus from facebook busying ourselves with the operation of the business. We'll be working out a promotion soon so stay tune! Meanwhile if you've noticed a slight change in taste in our milk teas you are right about your senses! We did something to it :P Meanwhile here is a beautiful photo taken at the Phu Chasai Mountain Resort in Chiang Rai, Thailand to kickstart your weekends and an inspiration for your next holiday destination. Have a great weekend! =)
