These few days my mum will have some free food. Lucky she took part in some CC activities. There will be chartered buses to bring her to rallies. I told her to eat more. Those with parents also can try their luck, some CC have buses to the rally sites. This year should be better than Nasi Lemak.

what a guilty weekend. I blame the constant bombardment of durian images on TV. For weeks now, I have been tricking my mother with cheap durians and passing them off as mao shan wang. I blame myself for being useless not able to give her a better life. somehow I think she knows. the lack of yellowness, the lack of deep flavour... The recent funeral downstairs did not help much either. 

my late father never got to experience really nice food. he slogged his whole life without eating any luxury food. so I saved for days. Mao shan wang was $12 a kilo. What luxury. normally, I would not even look at them cos I could never afford. so I saved for days, eating bread and biscuits, eating rice with eggs and canned meat. 

On saturday, I finally scrapped $40 to get 2 mao shan wang durians, I guessed that each durian weighed roughly 1.5kgs. so 2 should be 3 kg. $36 should pay for it. So I went, normally I would only dig around the smaller tiny $2 durians, the thrown away durians, sometimes the sellers would throw away some durians and I would pick and bring back. Still edible. So imagine the awkwardness as I asked for 2 mao shan wang.

The seller uncle picked up the durians, I urged him to give me rounder durians as they had more meat. he weighed them. To my horror, he asked for $45. apparently, each kg is now $15. I sheepishly opened my pouch, 4 ten dollar notes is all I have. he looked at my tattered slippers and loose T shirt. I guessed he pitied me, took the notes and handled me the fruit.

That day, my mother and I ate those durians, somehow the taste was much better. she ate slower. I guess she knows, she must have wanted to let the mao shan wang taste linger on the tongue longer. 

as the funeral noise continued downstairs, I wondered how much longer she can have some taste of the good life.

Breakfast : Bread with nutella! ~ 50cents

Lunch: Laksa $3.00 and yet another lifehack tip time!
Always buy Laksa from stalls dedicated to selling Laksa
1, The Laksa always tastes better
2, If you ask nicely, they can give you more Laksa gravy which is very very important. Always tabao! Tabao will give you more laksa  gravy than eating in. 

Dinner will be laksa also if you like. Keep the Laksa gravy in the fridge. It can last for a day.
you can buy the noodles, the tao gei, the tao bock etc etc from the market. Cook the noodles and stuff and use the laksa gravy from earlier. Viola! Two Laksa meals for roughly $4. 

if you have saved some bread also, eat them by dipping in the Laksa gravy. makes a yummy snack! dont waste the gravy!

Life hack time

how to have a very budget dinner?
make friends with the local Nasi Bryani seller. Bryani sellers always pre packed many packets of curry. These packets are disposed end of the day. Usually they make a lot. These curries are very useful. Good for eating with supermarket Roti Prata (another lifehack) good for eating with french loaf, eating with rice etc etc.... 

Key is sometimes there are pieces of meat and potato in the curries. Bonus ! Sometimes they even have Achar, you just have to ask nicely. The rice you can get from Cai Png sellers or cook yourself. Have a ok dinner for roughly 50 cents.

How to save money for breakfast and dinner 

Fried carrot cake is very easy to make. and the best of all, you can experiment like crazy. Get the raw carrot cake from supermarket. Egg, sesame sauce, oil, dark sauce, etc etc. Experiment!!!! anything goes! Cheap cheap cheap! much cheaper than the crazy $3 that the greedy hawker charge you. 

Lifehack, you know the chai bo from chwee kuey? save it and the oil! Even the chili sauce! get a small container and ka po a bit. many of the ingredients can be for free! 

Hehe! I estimate I spend 80 cent for a meal. Try it!

D: Dunno yet
Yesterday night was difficult to pass. I had the Subway cookie for dinner. Not enough, the hunger sounds kept coming. Again and again. Hunger is really a terrible feeling. Couldn't sleep for an hour. Lifehack time! How to sleep with hunger?
Warm water and condense milk! Mix 2 spoons of condense milk with warm water and drink. Don't drink too fast. Slowly let the stomach think that there is food coming. The milk content will also help you to sleep.

This is the most obvious. Skip breakfast, or drink plain water.
At night also drink plain water or get a 3 in 1 milo from the company pantry and bring home.
