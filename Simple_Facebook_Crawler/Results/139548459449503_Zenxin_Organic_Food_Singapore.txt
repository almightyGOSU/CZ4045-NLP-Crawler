We had an interesting introductory presentation from Widjaja Kentjana from Wisk teas where he showed us how to brew the new organic teas we have in the shop. Wisk teas are whole leaf, green, Oolong and black teas, all accredited by JAS, USDA and EU organic certification boards. 

The original source of tea is Yunnan province in China where tea drinking began perhaps as much as 5,000 years ago. Tea was originally used as a medicine but quickly found its way into local cuisine and customs, becoming an art form and also part of the customary offerings to the deities. 

Teas vary in oxidation level. Green tea will normally be below 10% oxidized and is high in anti-oxidants and caffeine. Oolong tea can range from 10% - 90% and Black tea is fully oxidized. As oxidation increases the catechin content decreases. Catechins are disease fighting flavonoids and antioxidants.

One British study undertaken by UCL noted that tea drinkers were able to de-stress more quickly than those given a placebo. Those who drank a black tea x4/day for 6 weeks were found to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood after a stressful event, compared with a control group. Good news for tea drinking Singaporeans!

Constance's Oatmeal Blueberry Walnut Muffins

You will need:
1¼ cups of 'Simply Natural' Australian organic rolled oats
1 cup of 'Simply Natural' organic unbleached plain flour
1 tbsp aluminium-free baking powder 
½ tsp of 'Simply Natural' French Sea Salt
1 cup of 'Simply Natural' organic coconut nectar sugar
Zest of 1 Zenxin Organic lemon 
1 egg
1 cup of goat’s milk
¼ cup of 'Simply Natural' virgin cold-pressed coconut oil
1 cup of Zenxin Organic blueberries
1 cup of 'Simply Natural' premium raw walnut

Method:
Preheat the oven to 180° C.
Mix all the dry ingredients together: rolled oats, flour, baking powder, sea salt, coconut nectar sugar and half the amount of lemon zest.
In another bowl mix together the wet ingredients, first beating the egg and then stirring in
the goat's milk and coconut oil. 
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until barely combined.
The key with muffin batters is not to over-stir.  
Gently fold the blueberries and walnuts into the batter.  
Divide batter equally among muffin cups filling each cup about ¾ full.
This is a truly nutritious and wholesome muffin batter.

Bake for 20 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
Sprinkle rest of lemon zest on top of muffins and enjoy!

In this recipe we used blueberries and walnuts, but the great thing is the recipe can adapted  to use your own favourite combinations. Try buttery macadamia nuts and chocolate chips, bananas and raw cacao nibs, grapes and roasted cashews and  many more.

1 tbsp 'Simply Natural' organic virgin cold-pressed coconut oil
1/8 tsp 'Simply Natural' organic cinnamon
A pinch of vanilla powder
pure filtered water

Our Australian barley flakes are a wonderful source of both soluble and insoluble fibre. This fibre also provides food for the 'good' bacteria in the intestinal tract and can help them establish a better foothold to crowd out disease causing bacteria.

Barley’s insoluble fiber yields propionic acid that helps keep the blood cholesterol levels low, while its soluble fibre,'beta-glucan', slows down glucose absorption and helps regulate blood sugar. 

It's also a good source of Selenium which helps slow down ageing and preserve skin elasticity and helps lower the risk of colon cancer.

This rice is not the glutinous black rice used locally in 'pulut hitam', but rather a variant of Thai fragrant rice with a black husk or bran which turns purple when cooked. Not only does it have a great nutty taste, it also is nutritionally a great source of anthocyanins.

Associate professor Zhimin Xu of the Dept. of Food Science at Louisiana State University Agricultural Centre, Baton Rouge states that "Just a spoonful of black rice bran contains more health promoting anthocyanin antioxidants than are found in a spoonful of blueberries, but with more fibre and vitamin E antioxidants. 
Black power or what?

No Claypot Black Rice with Chicken and Mushroom
You will need:
2 cups 'Simply Natural'  organic black rice 
10 'Simply Natural' organic dried white shiitake mushrooms
2 - 2.5 cups pre-made 'Simply Natural' steamboat stock
400g chicken fillet 
4cm knob of younger ginger (finely grated)
A good pinch of 'Simply Natural' French sea salt 
1-2 tbsp 'Simply Natural' organic, cold-pressed virgin coconut oil
2-3 Zenxin Organic red chilli padi
Finely chopped Zenxin Organic coriander and/or chives to garnish

Method:
Put the black rice to soak overnight and throw away the first soaking water in the morning.

To enhance the flavour of the chicken, first cut it into bite size pieces, then rub a mixture of salt and freshly grated young ginger into the meat several hours before cooking. 

Soak to rehydrate the dried shiitake mushrooms.  Once the mushrooms are plump, squeeze out the excess water and slice.  Save the mushroom water for cooking with the black rice.

Cook the soaked black rice with mushroom water and steamboat stock in the rice cooker.  
Ratio 2 cups of rice to 3 cups of stock/mushroom water.

In a heavy bottomed pan, add coconut oil and pan sear the seasoned chicken pieces till brown on one side. Turn chicken pieces over to sear the other side, then add mushroom and continue cooking.
Serve chicken and mushroom mixture on top of the cooked black rice and garnish with coriander and/or chives and chilli padi.

This is a simple and very healthy version of the Chinese Chicken Clay pot rice.

Frittata with Black Rice and Basil
You will need:
Leftover Black Rice with Chicken and Mushroom from the previous recipe
8 large eggs
Big bunch of Zenxin Organic Thai sweet basil leaves, roughly chopped
1 Zenxin Organic  red bell pepper (sliced)
1/2 a Zenxin Organic onion (sliced)
1-2 Zenxin Organic red chilli padi
Cilantro/Chives
A pinch of 'Simply Natural' French Sea Salt 
'Simply Natural ' virgin organic coconut oil

Method:
Pre-heat oven to 180° C.
In a 9” heavy based pan or skillet, heat up coconut oil and stir fry red bell pepper and onion till the onion looks translucent.
Add in the leftover black rice with chicken and mushroom.
Whisk eggs with desired amount of French sea salt and pour over the red bell pepper, onion and black rice.  
Tilt the pan to make sure the eggs settle evenly over all the ingredients. 
Place Thai basil leaves over the egg mixture.  
Cook until the eggs at the edges of the pan begin to set.  
Put entire pan in the oven and bake for 8 - 10 minutes until the eggs are set.
This is an entire meal on its own.

After the BBQ Primrose requested we make another batch and share it with our readers :)

Zenxin BBQ Garlic butter

You will need:
250g Sierra Nevada salted, vat cultured, organic butter
3 cloves Zenxin Organic garlic
2 large Zenxin Organic green chillies
3 tsp 'Simply Natural' BBQ seasoning
¼ tsp 'Simply Natural' French sea salt

Method:
Take out the butter to warm to room temperature, cut into cubes.
Peel and finely dice the garlic cloves.
Wash, top and tail the green chillies, then cut in half lengthways and remove the seeds. 
Slice into strips, then dice.
Begin to mash the butter with a fork, adding the sea salt and BBQ seasoning.
Add the chopped garlic and dice green chilli, finish mashing to combine thoroughly.

This makes wonderful garlic bread when spread on thinly sliced toast or prepared in a baguette that is toasted on the BBQ. A small knob of the butter added to cooked meats or steamed vegetables is equally delicious.

This can be kept for at least a week in the fridge.

Using these deadly chemicals has become all too common in farming
And Monsanto hasn’t stopped there.  No, they have an army of lawyers attacking anyone who dares to challenge their almighty money machine.
They’ve recently sued Vermont and other states to stop mandatory labeling of GMO foods.  These states are not trying to ban GMO foods, mind you, they are simply trying to let the consumer know that their food contains GMOs!
And they’ve recruited supposedly ‘organic grocery chains’ like Whole Foods to help them sue states.  The very companies that proclaim to be about ‘healthy eating’ are trying to make sure that you’ll NEVER know what is really in your food.
They’ve even sued farmers who WEREN’T using their GMO seeds, because Monsanto’s seeds had taken root on their property after being carried there by the wind.
Even the corrupt and archaic Russian government has classified GMOs as a secret ‘biowarfare weapon’.
The Obama Administration Is Part Of The Conspiracy Against Your Food

Quinoa with Okra

You will need:
1 cup 'Simply Natural' Quinoa
2 cups of water
2 Zenxin Organic lady’s fingers (okra), cut into ½ cm thickness
½ cup organic cranberries
½ cup 'Simply Natural' pine nuts
Bunch of  Zenxin Organic coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped
1/2 Zenxin Organic lemon
'Simply Natural' French sea salt
'Simply Natural' organic cold-pressed virgin coconut oil

Method:
Cook 1 cup of quinoa in 2 cups of boiling water, add sea salt and coconut oil as desired.(This can also be cooked in the rice cooker.) Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. When water is almost fully absorbed, but quinoa still moist, turn off heat. Add okra to cook in residual heat. When almost cooled, add pine nuts and cranberries.
Juice ½ Zenxin Organic lemon and serve.

N.B. Okra can be eaten raw and is very delicate so needs very little heat to cook.

Zenxin Organic June's recipe theme is Okra or Lady's finger.

This the first healthy recipe theme offered by our new Wellness Ambassador Mrs Singapore Planet 2015, Constance Lim. They were inspired by a visit to Zenxin Organic Park where she saw the fields of lady's fingers, she found out they are very versatile, combine well with different herbs and spices and can be eaten raw.

The green tender pods grow very well in tropical or warm temperate regions and are thought to have originated in Africa. They still figure largely in West Africa and North-East African diets today, where they are known as 'bamia'.

Lady's Finger (Abelmoschus esculentus) is a member of the Mallow family Malvaceae, and the pods are a rich source of mucilage, a substance that helps soothe the gut and ease constipation. A high fibre content also helps stabilize blood sugar and absorption and they also contain Vit B9 (folate), Vit C and Vit K to support the immune system. 

So they are a great addition to any diet, improving digestion, helping prevent diabetes and improving overall health. You might even like to try growing them at home as they grow quite well in containers! They like a well-drained manure-rich soil and take 45-60 days from seed to harvest. You can have a healthy 'garden' even in an urban environment!

The new shipment of Thai rice is in! Today we sampled the brown rice, soaked overnight, cooked with broccoli leaves and served with fresh baby Roma tomatoes. Our new shelves display the spices from Rajasthan and of course we are serving our Darjeeling tea and Mulberry tea from Zenxin Organic Park, Kluang.
Tomorrow we will sample the black rice. The purple colour comes from the antioxidant anthocyanin. Is black rice Asia's new superfood?

This is a very simple recipe using our Simply Natural Hari Raya Cookie pack. It uses the Thermomix and oat flour. Oats are known to be high in beta-glucan, soluble fibre which helps the cardiovascular system.

250g Simply Natural organic oat flour
100g potato flour
150g salted butter
50g organic castor sugar
1 beaten Zenxin egg

Add the flours and butter into the Thermomix and blend at 6 for about 10 seconds. Add in the castor sugar and blend for another 5 seconds. Turn out the dough and add in the beaten egg. When the dough is well combined roll it out on a floured board to the required thickness, then cut out in the shapes chosen.

Bake the cookies in an oven preheated to 180° C for about 9 minutes. Allow to cool.

Whisk 2 tablespoons of Mt Hagen organic coffee granules with 1 tbsp of boiling water and add to 100g icing sugar. (The icing sugar can also be made in the Thermomix from organic sugar.)

Dot a little of the icing on the centre of each cookie and add a walnut on each from the Hari Raya cookie pack. Enjoy!

Hi, we purchased a bag of organic oatmeals for our baby. I was about to prepare his first oatmeal breakfast when I noted something crawling in the bowl. Upon closer inspection of the entire bag, we realised that the entire bag of oatmeals was crawling with insects, even though it was completely sealed up prior to this.

Another note regarding juices from an article by Sarah from the "Life with Greens" site.

Bottled juice has passed through flash pasteurization at >121° C to kill microorganisms and extend shelf life. 

This drastically reduces antioxidant activity, and denatures proteins and enzymes. Essentially the good stuff is gone. As my German doctor would say, bottled juice is sugar water!

Bottled juice is devoid of fibre and loaded with simple processed dead sugar (fructose) which may contribute eventually to the body developing diabetes Type 2.

When fresh juices are consumed they offer the body badly needed nourishment in the form of enzymes and nutrients. If you are lucky your juicer will also allow you to add in variable amounts of fibre.

Sweet and earthy, and known to enrich the blood, the humble beetroot supports your health as you age in a stressful urban environment. Zenxin's fresh organic beetroot comes in from farms in Australia especially for you! 

A few posts ago we shared an item from the Rodale Institute that suggested that beetroot, improves sexual vitality. 

Today a customer walked in and asked about its ability to reduce high blood pressure. 

A recent trial from the Canadian Medical Association Journal confirms that not only is it an excellent source of antioxidants, but it also contains natural nitrates which help open up the vascular system and increase oxygen flow while lowering blood pressure.

Best eaten raw or as fresh juice, beetroot makes a wonderful addition to your rainbow diet.
