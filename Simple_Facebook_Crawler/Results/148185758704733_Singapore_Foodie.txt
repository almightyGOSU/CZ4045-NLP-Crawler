Feeling so sad today about the state of the world. This little piece of sweetness has gone some way to restoring my faith in humanity. Just delivered to my desk by Ash from Blue Collar Collaborative as a treat. Small things can make a difference. Thanks Ash!

My beautiful mum has taken up cake baking in her retirement. Rhubarb and pistachio with halva was a gorgeous consistency and I think she has potential in the country fairs! #countrylife #flowerdale

If you're looking for something food related to do this weekend check out the Suvai Festival near Bugis. This was one of the best food festivals I've enjoyed in Singapore. The quality of food, lack of crowds, reasonable prices and good live music made me want to go back again tonight! I wrote a short blog I was so impressed http://www.singaporefoodie.com/indian-suvai-festival-2015/

Another awesome walking tour with @betelbox yesterday. This is a raw fish salad from the fish porridge stall at Maxwell. Gorgeous concoction of freshness and spice for five bucks that would have cost $20 at a restaurant.  I'll be writing a blog about Tony's tours soon.

My second time visiting this awesome deli. Took a colleague who's originally from Montreal where I believe they are somewhat experts in the art of bagels. Big  from her (and me). The pastrami is still the winner for me although today's chicken schnitzel was still good.

Singapore Foodie has been a little quiet on FB :( Last week I was in Australia enjoying the very remote area of Arnhem Land. Spectacular to say the least. Then I celebrated a birthday (ho hum) and now I'm very much looking forward to the weekend. What about you? If you're after somewhere for an adults only brunch, check out Manhattan at the Regent hotel. The experience was a lot different to some of the other brunches I've written about it but well worth the visit and I'll be back http://www.singaporefoodie.com/a-manhattan-brunch/

Decided to leave the awesome Indian food for dinner tomorrow night (instagramers will know what I mean!) and have leftovers tonight. Who would have thought that bolognaise (which is Obv so much better 3 days later) served on top of a Chinese coleslaw would work? Not me but it totally did! Crunchy salad with rich beef sauce = delicious!

The way to my heart is through food! Last night Husband pulled out all the stops to cook me dinner after a few complaints from my side about his lack of kitchen performance ? it worked a treat so I advise anyone out there who has someone who regularly cooks for them and nurtures them to, just occasionally, show your appreciation by the simple act of cooking food for them ?

A sad day for Singapore today. But also time to reflect on the legacy left by the inimitable Lee Kuan Yew. A great man who, in only 50 years, led this country to what it is today. Nothing is perfect but this little red dot is an example of how nationhood and identity can be achieved in a relatively short amount of time. Respect. #ThankyouLKY

Today we headed up to Serangoon to visit Dignity Kitchen. We met Komala who spent time talking to us about the project and how they help people with special needs or difficult circumstances by training them in various kitchen and f&b related skills. It's a wonderful place and a great idea. I mainly went because I'd seen they were selling pineapple tarts and cookies for Chinese New Year. We tasted the cookies and they were fabulous so we've brought 8 boxes home to hand out as gifts. They're $18 for a large box and they're seriously good. Head up there and get some if you can :)

Do you ever miss cooking when you're on holiday? After over 2 weeks away I was hankering to get in the kitchen and Mum and I came up with the random idea to make an old fashioned Beef Wellington. We may not have made the pâté or pastry from scratch but it was damn good - might have been something to do with the old Women's Weekly recipe that included loads of butter!

A truly Australian treat yesterday evening. These yabbies were caught in a dam at my parents' place then tossed in some oil and garlic and barbecued before being devoured. They tasted just slightly 'muddy' and a cross between a prawn and a crayfish. When was the last time you ate a yabby?

Just bit into this super juicy nectarine. Had to hang my head over the sink to eat it whilst the juice dropped down my arm! Reminds me of summer in Australia

What do you think about 'arty' food? This photo was taken last night in Hong Kong where I'm visiting friends. The food looked amazing and tasted good but at the end I think some of us were left slightly wanting for more substance over style.

Question: What kind of food do you like to eat if you're not drinking (alcohol)? I'm partaking in 'Dryvember' with a friend and we need to make sure we can at least eat well for the month, without the strong desire to reach for a glass of wine...Let me know your thoughts :)

Difficult decision of the day number 1. Sweet or savoury breakfast. Definitely happy with the French toast decision but feeling a teensy bit sick now

I have a question. I'm wondering what your favourite dessert in Singapore is? I haven't tried many, I do like Putu Piring and I've had Ice Kaicang but what else is there that you really love? Thanks all!

Love it or hate it we're about to get walloped with the F1 again this weekend. Are you all going to embrace it or avoid it like the plague? I am all for embracing, especially with visitors in town for the event. If you are looking for alternatives though there are plenty to be found...and unsurprisingly there's food involved in all of them! http://www.singaporefoodie.com/avoid-embrace-singapore-grand-prix/

Still reeling after eating this brilliant concoction. This buah keluak ice-cream was completely divine. For those who don't know buah keluak, or 'black nut' as it's often called, is a native nut to this part of the world but has to be fermented to remove the poison (a kind of cyanide) before it can be safely consumed. Normally it's served with meat but in this instance chef Malcolm at Candlenut has combined the buah keluak with ice-cream and Valrhona chocolate to produce a beautiful taste sensation. Highly recommended. More on the blog.

Hello everyone and hi to all those new likers! I've been quiet lately with visitors in town and then a trip to Cambodia. So this week I'm on a massive health kick. I've started the day with fruit and hot lemon water and will have a coconut water to keep me going through the day. Dinner will be fish and lots of veggies. What are your favourite detox foods and drinks?

A well deserved coconut smoothie after hiking 10 km to Shek o beach in Hong Kong today. Coconut in any form is such a rejuvenating drink. Love.

There's a hair in there. Urgh, seriously, I took this photo before I started eating because I thought it actually looked quite decent for cheap airline food. About half way through I found a black hair. Of course I stopped eating instantly but then I had the dilemma of whether to ask for another serving. What would you do?

Does anyone else remember these? They are toffee apples. An apple covered in a thin layer of toffee. They used to be a treat in Australia when I was a kid. Saw them in an IGA supermarket in Sydney the other day

What kind of food makes you feel better after a 'bad food' day? Yesterday I had pork belly and a burger among other things and this very green and very yummy raw asparagus and coconut soup for lunch today was the perfect antidote.
