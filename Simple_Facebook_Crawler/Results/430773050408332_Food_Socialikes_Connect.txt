We were talking about copyright issues. Apparently this artist plagiarized other people's photos, and sold them for $90K for each photo, and it's legal.

Thanks to all who participated in the blogging challenge. It was a big headache to choose the winner, because writing is subjective and each delegate has their unique style and perspective. The results are very close. 


After a round of discussion and multiple voting, Iris won herself a voucher for two for Chocolate Rhapsody Afternoon Tea at Landing Point, The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore. Congrats!

Dear Socialikes, 

Thank you for participating in the goodie bag challenge. There are so many amazing entries that it was extremely difficult to pick a winning entry. 

After much headache, and after many discussions and rounds of voting, we finally decided on @eileenongxt as the winner. We were impressed by her hard work of cooking everything in the goodie bag, and that she has a seafood theme to link all the sponsors. Congratulations!

In case you haven't heard, the conference is now moved to Lime House. 

“Lime” is a term which originates from the beautiful Caribbean country of Trinidad & Tobago and means to hang out with friend. Rooted in this closely held Caribbean tradition of “liming”, the Lime House experience delivers on its aim of bringing a true essence of the Caribbean to Singapore.

The Lime House menu was created and is overseen by renowned Trinidadian chef Hasan DeFour. The diverse origins of the Caribbean region’s population – Native Amerindian, European, African, Indian and Chinese - make Caribbean cuisine a true fusion and lends itself to a wide variety of exciting tastes. Traditional Caribbean dishes such as Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Plantain Batons, Curry Goat, Red Snapper Escovitch and Trinidadian “Doubles” and Macaroni Pie appear on the menu alongside exciting new creations borrowing from Caribbean flavours and concepts. Enter dishes such as the Jerk Beef Carpaccio, Coffee Jerk Rubbed Ribeye and Deconstructed Pina Colada.

The Lime House experience is enjoyed against the distinctive back drop of a beautifully restored multi-storey shop house on Jiak Chuan Road, in the Keong Saik belt of Singapore’s Chinatown. The heritage building, with its original wooden carvings and tiles and dramatically high ceilings, houses 3 floors as well as the “Lime Yard”, an intimate backyard space with a chilled out tropical garden-themed lounge.

[Panel]
With the demise of our Founding Father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we are doing a Black and White theme for today JUST FOR THIS POST.

Introducing one of our panelists, Ms Bernice Tan who is a lawyer and able to give legal advice and insights for Panel 2: Rights of food bloggers and instagrammers.

Lawyer by day, and food blogger by night (and also sometimes during a slow(ish) day...okay, okay, often times during the work day), Bernice Tan started blogging at The Hungry Bunny because she was tired of repeating herself to her friends about the amazing (or awful, as the case may be) foods she's had. Now, she just blogs about what she ate, and directs her friends to her blog link accordingly.

[Panel]
The HIGHLIGHT of this event: The ONE and ONLY event that you get to meet ALL the TOP Food Bloggers in Singapore at one go! Yes, there's no other events where you will meet EVERY SINGLE ONE! So what are you waiting for? Follow us and get all the new updates as we reveal the speakers that U had been waiting for.

We are honored to have @misstamchiak as one of our panels for this event!
Maureen Ow started her food blog Miss Tam Chiak (“tam chiak” is a dialect phrase for “greedy”) in 2007 when she was still in university. She writes about her personal experiences from her daily life, dishing out honest reviews about food and dining places, as well as countries and cities that she travels to.

Upon graduation, she joined Singapore Press Holdings as a food journalist with My Paper Chinese where she started weekly restaurant and hawker review columns. Growing up in a family of foodies, Maureen has been a close observer of the rapid changes in the Singapore food scene. Her blog has been featured in many respected newspapers and magazines.
