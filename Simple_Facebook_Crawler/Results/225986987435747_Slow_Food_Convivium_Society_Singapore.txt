I had a charming tour of the edible garden after lunch and was pleasantly surprised that so many herbs and plants could grow in our tropical heat. We'll be grazing from this garden at the next tasting event!

Hi Guys,

SFCSS Trial Tasting TE # 139 Portico Restaurant
Posting # 1

I have not been to a trial tasting for a SFCSS event for many moons due to my travel and other commitments.

However, this time round, I was able to make it  for the Trial Tasting for TE#139, scheduled for the last Saturday, 26 September 2015, at Portico Restaurant at 991B Alexander Road, just opposite the HP Building and PSA Towers, this Wednesday 2 September 2015.

The SFCSS, at long last, was able to meet up with Proprietor TY Chia, who is fully committed to supporting local farms and food producers in Singapore and who together with his kitchen team, has come up with a wonderful tasting menu, normally for a minimum of 10 pax. And this was created last October 2014 in association with a popular lifestyle magazine.

We had an amazing trial tasting lasting from 2 - 5.30pm; each of the dishes were very creatively done up and the flavours were both exquisite and fulsome.

I highly recommend this event to our Real Slow Foodies and their friends. 

We were able to negotiate for 35 pax maximum for this end of September event and Grace, our other Vice Chairman Events, shall be sending out soon the FRN and Menu with the wine pairings. 

So be nice to her and send her an early email and book your seats for you and makan friends.

The other postings to come are the SFCSS video interview with Proprietor Chia and Presentations by Chef Nixon Low.

Cheers

SV

Hi to All Real Slow Foodies and Friends,

We just had a wonderful event SFCSS TE # 137 at Alba 1836 this lazy Saturday afternoon with the MD MatteoTrabaldo Togna and his lovely wife Sarah, who were present and greeting all who were there and they were on hand in saying their goodbyes on our departure.What a charming pair they are!!

GM Michele Zanella and his service staff, Rainbow, Faiz, Wati, Alex and Nabil did a fantastic job in replenishing the wines and graciously assisted with the prompt delivery of the food.

Head Chef Luca Piras, who presented his signature dish, the Roasted Lamb Loin in a Sardinian Pecorino Cheese Crust, Saffron Potatoe Puree and Morel Mushrooms, was ably assisted by his team comprising:-  Raymond,Elvis,Jing and Daryl.

Many thanks also to Committee Member Roland Yap, who captured the colors and exquisite pictures of the dishes in his earlier post and the presentation of the SFCSS momento to Alba 1836 team.

Heartiest congratulation to Grace, as always, and special thanks to SK Yeo, who all helped in getting over 30 members and guests to this slow friendly gathering.

Pictures are enclosed showing the gathering, menu and pictures with the description of the dishes and the accompanying wines.

Yours Aye in Slowness

Hi Guys,

Ariana Bundy who used to be a member of SFCSS some years back sent me the following text message:

"Hi Jen Shek, how are you? Very very long time :) My husband and I often think about Singapore and one of the highlights of living there were your Slow Food lunches with the amazing crowd and amazing wine!

I wanted to let you know that my new TV show Ariana's Persian Kitchen will air on Nat Geo People May 8th in 98 countries, which includes all of Asia.

I thought of you in Singapore, since I haven't been back since and do not have food contacts there (except Lynette Foo whom I'll also contact shortly).

I was wondering if you could help us find key people ie TV/food media people, magazine and bloggers to help spread the word and do write ups for my show? In fact, any tips welcome and appreciated.

Trailer to show can be found here http://bit.ly/1OJc5FH"

Please watch her trailer and you will feel inspired about her passion for all the finer aspects of Persian cuisine.

The program premiered on National Geographic People on 8 May 2015 and will repeat this Friday at 8.50pm on NGP. 

Please make sure that you catch the repeat and spread the words round.

Enjoy!!

Yours Aye in Slowness

Hi All you Real Slow Foodies,

I thought that I should share some comments which I made to an earlier post from Ivan Ng from his Facebook :

And this was what I posted :

"Dear Ivan, very well put. In fact, street hawker food in Singapore in the period before and after WW II in the 1950s and early 1960s before they were corralled into Hawker Centers were based on pure competition and the stake out of one's sphere of culinary skills. I could still remember the Hokkien Mee stalls in old Hokkien Street where we would drive to after the 9pm movies from Odeon or Capitol and we would wrangle our way into emerging spaces to park our cars to tuck into delicious bowls of soups and pig tails and the powdered chili. Those in the West who espouse the state of origin of food produce and zero food waste just cannot understand the creativity of local chefs of yore and how they reduced waste and make use of everything to improve the taste, including extracting water moisture from food produce as there were no refrigerators then, and then learnt the art of refreshing them with local spices and condiments. JuHu ( cuttlefish) Eng Chye is just one fine example. It's thanks to comrades  like you that we hold strong the movement to be ourselves and the essence of a Real Slow Foodie. 

Cheers SV"

I hope that Ivan will share with us his pictures and comments which prompted my remarks.

Yours Aye in Slowness

SV

PS There are still places at the next SFCSS TE at Morsels on 1 November 2014. Please send in your FRN and cheque to Grace early next week

Hi to all you Real Slow Foodies and Friends,

We just completed our Tasting at Morsels, at 35 Mayo Street, in the Jalan Besar and Dunlop Street vicinity.

Please find an interview with Chef Owners Peterina Loh and Bryan Chia, who met overseas in Northern California in Calistoga (Hwy 128, heading north, and turning right into a city of just over 5000 according to the 2010 census) and just passing Yountville and St. Helena, Napa Valley on the right.

Chefs Petrina and Bryan have been sharpening their culinary skills at this charmingly decorated  48 seater, with 10 at the bar counter, restaurant for over a year and a half. 

The meal was bursting with flavors and both of them had taken great care in the selection of the state of origin produce. And making them even more tasty with the art of marinating and smoking them with loving care. And you also just have to taste their special cheesecake dessert with smoked orange and oreo bits.

And to end the meal, just savor the coffee, which Chef Bryan sources from his passionate local roaster by the name of Dennis, who now also sources his beans directly from Costa Rica.

So you guys, whatever you are doing on Saturday, 1 November 2014, please clear the deck and send in your FRN and cheque to Grace for this not-to-be missed SFCSS tasting event.

Yours Aye in Slowness. 

SV
