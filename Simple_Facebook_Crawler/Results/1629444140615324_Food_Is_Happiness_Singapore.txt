Brunch @ Kith Cafe: prawn aglio olio is great with the right amount of olive oil and a bit spicy to enhance the taste. But the pricing is little high given the location. Worth making a trip down or you can go to the other outlets at Park Mall or Sentosa Cove. #kithcafe #pasta #poachedegg #blendedjuice #singaporeeats #singapore #instagram #brunch #food #foodporn #foodjournal

363 Katong Laksa @ Holland Village: not sure if it is the authentic version but still taste pretty good. Menu also includes nasi lemak.

Each one of them was just mouthwatering and palatable.

Nitamago Shio Ramen with Flavored Egg @ Tonkotsu Kazan: there are different soup bases that offer varied tastes to the ramen, coupled with thick slices of simmered pork belly. All in all, good quality ramen and worth walking out of the restaurant smelling like food (FIT knows some people hate the food smell on the clothes). Also they provide free hard - boiled eggs! #japanesefood #ramen #tonkotsukazanramen #food #foodporn #foodjournal #liangcourt
