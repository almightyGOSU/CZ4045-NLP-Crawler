Went to Bedok Market place for dinner yesterday evening. Great place to chilled out for nice food. Very busy for the restaurants or coffee shops around there. The renovation of Bedok Market place is very "retro". Beautiful renovation which changed the outlook for hawker centre.

IsTaman Jurong Food Centre the tallest hawker centre in Singapore? 3 storeys of good and cheap food. Hawker centre stores need to have very good food in order to have long queues. Highly competitive and too many choices.

I believed this is the LONGEST HAWKER CENTRE in Singapore. Blk 79 and Blk 79 A at Circuit road. I remember walking from Balam road to Circuit road hawker centres in the 70s along the BIG long Kang (drain) for Pasar Malam, Jogging etc till the community centre to watch TV. Still one of the favorite place for good food. - good omelette and hawker varieties.
