Hi Marche,

For the benefit of all potential customers of yours, I have decided to share this on your page so that they know what they're in for before dining at your restaurant. Nobody likes an unpleasant dining experience.

After reading your much delayed reply to my feedback (refer to my earlier post on your FB) and at least until you find a reasonable solution, I have decided that my previous visit will be my last, and it seems that this view is shared by many in my social circle as well.

Your policy is simply ridiculous. You expect your customers to either surrender their photo ID or to make payment for their unfinished meal just so that they can VISIT THE TOILET while having a meal in your restaurant. This causes much inconvenience, particularly when I was having a stomach upset when this incident happened to me.

Further, in an environment where there is much concern about safekeeping and protection of personal data, it does not seem reasonable to demand surrender of a photo ID, particularly since such identification would usually contain sensitive personal information that I would provide only in limited circumstances. It is not far fetched to think that there is a possibility our personal data may be compromised when we hand it over.

There are many other buffet restaurants or restaurants with a similar model where I have not encountered such a policy, and I am sure they share the same concerns of customers leaving without payment under the pretense of visiting the toilet. Perhaps your team should take a leaf from other operators to see how you can come up with a reasonable policy which works for you, but does not compromise the dining experience of your customers.

Hi Marché, as though your in-restaurant service is not bad enough, your "after-sales" service is even worse! After a lousy dining experience, I took time to send you a feedback for your awareness and improvement, but it's been more than one week and NOBODY bothered to even reply! With such attitude from the management, no wonder it breeds this type of service at ground level.

Before I have even step into Marche Suntec, I'm being greeted by a "friendly and courtesy" door staff at the entrance whom happens to like to roll her eyes, when her customer did not hear properly on what she's talking about and get her to repeat. Her name is Mery. This happens on at about 11.55am on 17th July 2015. It is also very interesting that she has an understanding problem on the question, when my wife is asking if the breakfast is still serving. More interestingly, when I request to speak to the branch manager, Mery's colleague, Mr. Asala, told me that Mery's is the manager, till I manager to get to speak to Jensen. Is Asala trying to cover up??? What's more even more disappointing is that, after feedback to the manager, no actions were taken immediately. Instead he went back to his counter to carry on cooking. Seems like he's encouraging such practices in this branch. Well done

Took my parents to your 313 Somerset orchard branch. They ordered 2 glasses of wine (self service - collected by themselves) when we settled the bill then realised was $28 per glass!!!!!!! The signage above the "wine station" is both tiny and poorly displayed.  The wine was average quality. I am disgusted by this - to put into comparison the Marriott hotel charges $22 dollars for a high quality glass of wine, served to your table in a luxury setting - you are a basement self service cafe ripping off customers - will not be back and will be spreading the word re your "prices"

Was at the Jems outlet on 12th June for dinner.  Service is above average. But was quite dissapointed with the two ribeyes that was served.  One was only 4mm thick while the other was about 13mm.  It looked like it came from2 different worlds.  The thinner steak looks smaller probably because of shrinkage by cooking, was also less juicy and tasted more salty.You must make sure your vendor delivers consistency is you want to be consistent.

To be fair, your service staff offered to change but I declined as i would not be able to finish the replacement and don't like to waste food.

Please don't just reply to me as it is not important anymore. it would be better if you alert all your outlets as this looks like a systemic failure rather than a one off event.

On 29th May 2015 at about 2140, I unfortunately had an extremely bad encounter with a chef at the Rosti counter at the VivoCity outlet. After taking my order, I decided to stand by the side to allow other customers to have their orders taken, thinking that the chef would notify me when my order was ready (most customers walked away from the counter while waiting for their orders to be cooked). However, I started noticing several customers, who had their orders taken after me, return to the station and walking away with their food. I went up to the chef and repeated my order politely, thinking that it would be done since others who came way before me had their food already. To my dismay, the chef commented Next time can you wait here and dont go elsewhere. I have many orders.

This incident made me extremely unhappy as I have and had been standing close to the counter, within the view of the chef. Why was the rude remark only directed to me even though I had been standing there? I understand that there is immense pressure of keeping up with orders and there might have been a misunderstanding. However, even IF I were to walk away from the station, should such remarks even be made? Perhaps a number system could be used at crowded stations that require longer waiting time? This will greatly avoid confusion and misunderstandings. 

I do hope that the management at Marché would look into this matter seriously and resolve this issue to enhance customers experience. I entered the restaurant greeted by warm and friendly staffs, thinking that it would be a pleasant dinner as this was my first visit. But the horrible attitude that I had experienced ruined it, and would definitely make me think twice about going back to Marché for a meal again.

Dear Sir / Madam,

Not sure if you can help me, but thought that you could possibly point me in the right direction.

Based on your online profile, your company appears to be a company which utilizes corporate gifts and premiums.

Would you happen to be the person in charge or would you know whom in your organization I could speak with in regards to such services?

My name is Randy and I am in charge of the "Customized corporate gifts and premiums" department at Trivax Trading.

Any help you could provide would be very graciously appreciated.

Lastly, I have attached a copy of my company's profile for your reference.

Looking forward to you reply.

Thank you.
