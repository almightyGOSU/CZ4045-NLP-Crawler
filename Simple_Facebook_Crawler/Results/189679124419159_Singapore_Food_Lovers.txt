Hi everyone I will be giving away sets of $20 food vouchers to 4 lucky winners! The vouchers are from Sakae sushi and Pu Tien and still have a long validation date. Proof http://oi44.tinypic.com/2r6fjts.jpg

My name is Bryan and I am currently a student at a hotel school in Switzerland. As part of my undergraduate degree requirements I need to complete a dissertation. Being Singaporean myself I wanted to try and discover a bit more about how we perceived certain restaurant pricing strategies. 

I know that conducting surveys on pages is rather frowned upon and the whole idea of responding to a survey can be rather distasteful but it would be an immense help. To compensate for your time (The survey just takes 5 minutes !)  Feel free to distribute the survey to your friends to increase your chance of winning but do remember to leave a contact e-mail so that I can mail you the vouchers at the end of the collection period!

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-flRmv_NjqynJgz3MWwuh21_BQK6VtQSCiOKYnOf9D0/viewform

Thank you very much. 

(And to the individuals who find me posting this here very repulsive, I do apologize and rest assured I will take this thread down as soon as I can! Thank you for your understanding!)

"Ok people, here’s the real deal. This is Singapore street food at it’s best. Not for the fussy kind, not for people who think it’s “too fishy”, not for hard-core vegetarians either (err.. yeah, vegetarians have been known to blur their realities in Singapore). This is the cheapest yummy meal you will get in and around Bukit Timah Singapore!

Most of my “SCORE!!” meals come in the 4 to 5 dollar range..." --Read on:

Nothing beats the feel-good, get-together spirit of a community aka the kampung spirit. And the Singapore Democrats want to re-kindle that very Singaporean tradition.
That's why we warmly invite you to join us at the Kampung Kook-Off on 25 November 2012, Sunday, in a first-ever, fun-filled food-fair.
