Nothing beats the feel-good, get-together spirit of a community aka the kampung spirit. And the Singapore Democrats want to re-kindle that very Singaporean tradition.
That's why we warmly invite you to join us at the Kampung Kook-Off on 25 November 2012, Sunday, in a first-ever, fun-filled food-fair.
